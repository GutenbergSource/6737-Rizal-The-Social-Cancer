<p class="par first">&ldquo;We travel rapidly in these historical
sketches. The reader flies in his express train in a few minutes
through a couple of centuries. The centuries pass more slowly to those
to whom the years are doled out day by day. Institutions grow and
beneficently develop themselves, making their way into the hearts of
generations which are shorter-lived than they, attracting love and
respect, and winning loyal obedience; and then as gradually forfeiting
by their shortcomings the allegiance which had been honorably gained in
worthier periods. We see wealth and greatness; we see corruption and
vice; and one seems to follow so close upon the other, that we fancy
they must have always co-existed. We look more steadily, and we
perceive long periods of time, in which there is first a growth and
then a decay, like what we perceive in a tree of the forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">Monasticism&rsquo;s record in the Philippines
presents no new general fact to the eye of history. The attempt to
eliminate the eternal feminine from her natural and normal sphere in
the scheme of things there met with the same certain and signal
disaster that awaits every perversion of human activity. Beginning with
a band of zealous, earnest men, sincere in their convictions, to whom
the cause was all and their personalities nothing, it there, as
elsewhere, passed through its usual cycle of usefulness, stagnation,
corruption, and degeneration.</p>
<p class="par">To the unselfish and heroic efforts of the early friars
Spain in large measure owed her dominion over the Philippine Islands
and the Filipinos a marked advance on the road to civilization and
nationality. In fact, after the dreams of sudden wealth from gold and
spices had faded, the islands were retained chiefly as a missionary
conquest and a stepping-stone to the broader fields of Asia, with
Manila as a depot for the Oriental trade. The records of those early
years are filled with tales of courage and heroism worthy of
Spain&rsquo;s proudest years, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

missionary fathers labored with unflagging zeal in disinterested
endeavor for the spread of the Faith and the betterment of the
condition of the Malays among whom they found themselves. They won the
confidence of the native peoples, gathered them into settlements and
villages, led them into the ways of peace, and became their protectors,
guides, and counselors.</p>
<p class="par">In those times the cross and the sword went hand in
hand, but in the Philippines the latter was rarely needed or used. The
lightness and vivacity of the Spanish character, with its strain of
Orientalism, its fertility of resource in meeting new conditions, its
adaptability in dealing with the dwellers in warmer lands, all played
their part in this as in the other conquests. Only on occasions when
some stubborn resistance was met with, as in Manila and the surrounding
country, where the most advanced of the native peoples dwelt and where
some of the forms and beliefs of Islam had been established, was it
necessary to resort to violence to destroy the native leaders and
replace them with the missionary fathers. A few sallies by young
Salcedo, the Cortez of the Philippine conquest, with a company of the
splendid infantry, which was at that time the admiration and despair of
martial Europe, soon effectively exorcised any idea of resistance that
even the boldest and most intransigent of the native leaders might have
entertained.</p>
<p class="par">For the most part, no great persuasion was needed to
turn a simple, imaginative, fatalistic people from a few vague
animistic deities to the systematic iconology and the elaborate ritual
of the Spanish Church. An obscure <i>Bathala</i> or a dim
<i>Malyari</i> was easily superseded by or transformed into a clearly
defined <i lang="es">Di&oacute;s</i>, and in the case of any especially
tenacious &ldquo;demon,&rdquo; he could without much difficulty be
merged into a Christian saint or devil. There was no organized
priesthood to be overcome, the primitive religious observances
consisting almost entirely of occasional orgies presided over by an old
woman, who filled the priestly offices of interpreter for the unseen
powers and chief eater at the sacrificial feast. With their unflagging
zeal, their organization, their elaborate forms and ceremonies, the
missionaries were enabled to win the confidence of the natives,
especially as the greater part of them learned the local language and
identified their lives with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e187"
href="#xd24e187" name="xd24e187">vii</a>]</span>communities under their
care. Accordingly, the people took kindly to their new teachers and
rulers, so that in less than a generation Spanish authority was
generally recognized in the settled portions of the Philippines, and in
the succeeding years the missionaries gradually extended this area by
forming settlements from among the wilder peoples, whom they persuaded
to abandon the more objectionable features of their old roving, often
predatory, life and to group themselves into towns and villages
&ldquo;under the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The tactics employed in the conquest and the subsequent
behavior of the conquerors were true to the old Spanish nature, so
succinctly characterized by a plain-spoken Englishman of Mary&rsquo;s
reign, when the war-cry of Castile encircled the globe and even hovered
<span class="corr" id="xd24e191" title=
"Source: omninously">ominously</span> near the &ldquo;sceptered
isle,&rdquo; when in the intoxication of power character stands out so
sharply defined: &ldquo;They be verye wyse and politicke, and can,
thorowe ther wysdome, reform and brydell theyr owne natures for a tyme,
and applye ther conditions to the manners of those men with whom they
meddell gladlye by friendshippe; whose mischievous maners a man shall
never know untyll he come under ther subjection; but then shall he
parfectlye parceve and fele them: for in dissimulations untyll they
have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrannye, when
they can obtain them, they do exceed all other nations upon the
earthe.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e194src" href="#xd24e194"
name="xd24e194src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">In the working out of this spirit, with all the
indomitable courage and fanatical ardor derived from the long contests
with the Moors, they reduced the native peoples to submission, but
still not to the galling yoke which they fastened upon the aborigines
of America, to make one Las Casas shine amid the horde of Pizarros.
There was some compulsory labor in timber-cutting and ship-building,
with enforced military service as rowers and soldiers for expeditions
to the Moluccas and the coasts of Asia, but nowhere the unspeakable
atrocities which in Mexico, Hispaniola, and South America drove mothers
to strangle their babes at birth and whole tribes to prefer
self-immolation to the living death in the mines and slave-pens. Quite
differently from the case in America, where entire islands and
districts were depopulated, to bring on later the curse of negro
slavery, in the Philippines the fact appears that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e202" href="#xd24e202" name=
"xd24e202">viii</a>]</span>native population really increased and the
standard of living was raised under the stern, yet beneficent, tutelage
of the missionary fathers. The great distance and the hardships of the
journey precluded the coming of many irresponsible adventurers from
Spain and, fortunately for the native population, no great mineral
wealth was ever discovered in the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p class="par">The system of government was, in its essential features,
a simple one. The missionary priests drew the inhabitants of the towns
and villages about themselves or formed new settlements, and with
profuse use of symbol and symbolism taught the people the Faith, laying
particular stress upon &ldquo;the fear of God,&rdquo; as administered
by them, reconciling the people to their subjection by inculcating the
Christian virtues of patience and humility. When any recalcitrants
refused to accept the new order, or later showed an inclination to
break away from it, the military forces, acting usually under secret
directions from the padre, made raids in the disaffected parts with all
the unpitying atrocity the Spanish soldiery were ever capable of
displaying in their dealings with a weaker people. After sufficient
punishment had been inflicted and a wholesome fear inspired, the padre
very opportunely interfered in the natives&rsquo; behalf, by which
means they were convinced that peace and security lay in submission to
the authorities, especially to the curate of their town or district. A
single example will suffice to make the method clear: not an isolated
instance but a typical case chosen from among the mass of records left
by the chief actors themselves.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Domingo Perez, evidently a man of courage and
conviction, for he later lost his life in the work of which he wrote,
was the Dominican vicar on the Zambales coast when that Order
temporarily took over the district from the Recollects. In a report
written for his superior in 1680 he outlines the method clearly:
&ldquo;In order that those whom we have assembled in the three villages
may persevere in their settlements, the most efficacious fear and the
one most suited to their nature is that the Spaniards of the fort and
presidio of Paynaven<a class="noteref" id="xd24e208src" href=
"#xd24e208" name="xd24e208src">2</a> of whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e216" href="#xd24e216" name=
"xd24e216">ix</a>]</span>they have a very great fear, may come very
often to the said villages and overrun the land, and penetrate even
into their old recesses where they formerly lived; and if perchance
they should find anything planted in the said recesses that they would
destroy it and cut it down without leaving them anything. And so that
they may see the father protects them, when the said Spaniards come to
the village, the father opposes them and takes the part of the Indians.
But it is always necessary in this matter for the soldiers to conquer,
and the father is always very careful always to inform the Spaniards by
whom and where anything is planted which it may be necessary to
destroy, and that the edicts which his Lordship, the governor, sent
them be carried out .... But at all events said Spaniards are to make
no trouble for the Indians whom they find in the villages, but rather
must treat them well.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e218src" href=
"#xd24e218" name="xd24e218src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">This in 1680: the Dominican transcriber of the record in
1906 has added a very illuminating note, revealing the immutability of
the system and showing that the rulers possessed in a superlative
degree the Bourbonesque trait of learning nothing and forgetting
nothing: &ldquo;Even when I was a missionary to the heathens from 1882
to 1892, I had occasion to observe the said policy, to inform the chief
of the fortress of the measures that he ought to take, and to make a
false show on the other side so that it might have no influence on the
fortress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thus it stands out in bold relief as a system built up
and maintained by fraud and force, bound in the course of nature to
last only as long as the deception could be carried on and the
repressive force kept up to sufficient strength. Its maintenance
required that the different sections be isolated from each other so
that there could be no growth toward a common understanding and
co&ouml;peration, and its permanence depended upon keeping the people
ignorant and contented with their lot, held under strict control by
religious and political fear.</p>
<p class="par">Yet it was a vast improvement over their old mode of
life <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e233" href="#xd24e233" name=
"xd24e233">x</a>]</span>and their condition was bettered as they grew
up to such a system. Only with the passing of the years and the
increase of wealth and influence, the ease and luxury invited by these,
and the consequent corruption so induced, with the insatiable longing
ever for more wealth and greater influence, did the poison of greed and
grasping power enter the system to work its insidious way into every
part, slowly transforming the beneficent institution of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries into an incubus weighing upon all the
activities of the people in the nineteenth, an unyielding bar to the
development of the country, a hideous anachronism in these modern
times.</p>
<p class="par">It must be remembered also that Spain, in the years
following her brilliant conquests of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, lost strength and vigor through the corruption at home
induced by the unearned wealth that flowed into the mother country from
the colonies, and by the draining away of her best blood. Nor did her
sons ever develop that economic spirit which is the permanent
foundation of all empire, but they let the wealth of the Indies flow
through their country, principally to London and Amsterdam, there to
form in more practical hands the basis of the British and Dutch
colonial empires.</p>
<p class="par">The priest and the soldier were supreme, so her best
sons took up either the cross or the sword to maintain her dominion in
the distant colonies, a movement which, long continued, spelled for her
a form of national suicide. The soldier expended his strength and
generally laid down his life on alien soil, leaving no fit successor of
his own stock to carry on the work according to his standards. The
priest under the celibate system, in its better days left no offspring
at all and in the days of its corruption none bred and reared under the
influences that make for social and political progress. The dark
chambers of the Inquisition stifled all advance in thought, so the
civilization and the culture of Spain, as well as her political system,
settled into rigid forms to await only the inevitable process of
stagnation and decay. In her proudest hour an old soldier, who had lost
one of his hands fighting her battles against the Turk at Lepanto,
employed the other in writing the masterpiece of her literature, which
is really a caricature of the nation.</p>
<p class="par">There is much in the career of Spain that calls to mind
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e241" href="#xd24e241" name=
"xd24e241">xi</a>]</span>dazzling beauty of her &ldquo;dark-glancing
daughters,&rdquo; with its early bloom, its startling&mdash;almost
morbid&mdash;brilliance, and its premature decay. Rapid and brilliant
was her rise, gradual and inglorious her steady decline, from the
bright morning when the banners of Castile and Aragon were flung
triumphantly from the battlements of the Alhambra, to the short summer,
not so long gone, when at Cavite and Santiago with swift, decisive
havoc the last ragged remnants of the once world-dominating power were
blown into space and time, to hover disembodied there, a lesson and a
warning to future generations. Whatever her final place in the records
of mankind, whether as the pioneer of modern civilization or the
buccaneer of the nations or, as would seem most likely, a goodly
mixture of both, she has at least&mdash;with the exception only of her
great mother, Rome&mdash;furnished the most instructive lessons in
political pathology yet recorded, and the advice to students of world
progress to familiarize themselves with her history is even more apt
today than when it first issued from the encyclopedic mind of Macaulay
nearly a century ago. Hardly had she reached the zenith of her power
when the disintegration began, and one by one her brilliant conquests
dropped away, to leave her alone in her faded splendor, with naught but
her vaunting pride left, another &ldquo;Niobe of nations.&rdquo; In the
countries more in contact with the trend of civilization and more
susceptible to revolutionary influences from the mother country this
separation came from within, while in the remoter parts the archaic and
outgrown system dragged along until a stronger force from without
destroyed it.</p>
<p class="par">Nowhere was the crystallization of form and principle
more pronounced than in religious life, which fastened upon the mother
country a deadening weight that hampered all progress, and in the
colonies, notably in the Philippines, virtually converted her
government into a hagiarchy that had its face toward the past and
either could not or would not move with the current of the times. So,
when &ldquo;the shot heard round the world,&rdquo; the declaration of
humanity&rsquo;s right to be and to become, in its all-encircling
sweep, reached the lands controlled by her it was coldly received and
blindly rejected by the governing powers, and there was left only the
slower, subtler, but none the less sure, process of working its way
among the people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e245" href=
"#xd24e245" name="xd24e245">xii</a>]</span>to burst in time in
rebellion and the destruction of the conservative forces that would
repress it.</p>
<p class="par">In the opening years of the nineteenth century the friar
orders in the Philippines had reached the apogee of their power and
usefulness. Their influence was everywhere felt and acknowledged, while
the country still prospered under the effects of the vigorous and
progressive administrations of Anda and Vargas in the preceding
century. Native levies had fought loyally under Spanish leadership
against Dutch and British invaders, or in suppressing local revolts
among their own people, which were always due to some specific
grievance, never directed definitely against the Spanish sovereignty.
The Philippines were shut off from contact with any country but Spain,
and even this communication was restricted and carefully guarded. There
was an elaborate central government which, however, hardly touched the
life of the native peoples, who were guided and governed by the parish
priests, each town being in a way an independent entity.</p>
<p class="par">Of this halcyon period, just before the process of
disintegration began, there has fortunately been left a record which
may be characterized as the most notable Spanish literary production
relating to the Philippines, being the calm, sympathetic, judicial
account of one who had spent his manhood in the work there and who,
full of years and experience, sat down to tell the story of their
life.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e251src" href="#xd24e251" name=
"xd24e251src">4</a> In it there are no puerile whinings, no querulous
curses that tropical Malays do not order their lives as did the people
of the Spanish village where he may have been reared, no selfish
laments of ingratitude over blessings unasked and only imperfectly
understood by the natives, no fatuous self-deception as to the real
conditions, but a patient consideration of the difficulties
encountered, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e262" href=
"#xd24e262" name="xd24e262">xiii</a>]</span>good accomplished, and the
unavoidable evils incident to any human work. The country and the
people, too, are described with the charming simplicity of the eyes
that see clearly, the brain that ponders deeply, and the heart that
beats sympathetically. Through all the pages of his account runs the
quiet strain of peace and contentment, of satisfaction with the
existing order, for he had looked upon the creation and saw that it was
good. There is &ldquo;neither haste, nor hate, nor anger,&rdquo; but
the deliberate recital of the facts warmed and illumined by the
geniality of a soul to whom age and experience had brought, not a sour
cynicism, but the mellowing influence of a ripened philosophy. He was
such an old man as may fondly be imagined walking through the streets
of Para&ntilde;aque in stately benignity amid the fear and respect of
the brown people over whom he watched.</p>
<p class="par">But in all his chronicle there is no suggestion of
anything more to hope for, anything beyond. Beautiful as the picture
is, it is that of a system which had reached maturity: a condition of
stagnation, not of growth. In less than a decade, the terrific
convulsions in European politics made themselves felt even in the
remote Philippines, and then began the gradual drawing away of the
people from their rulers&mdash;blind gropings and erratic wanderings at
first, but nevertheless persistent and vigorous tendencies.</p>
<p class="par">The first notable influence was the admission of
representatives for the Philippines into the Spanish Cortes under the
revolutionary governments and the abolition of the trade monopoly with
Mexico. The last galleon reached Manila in 1815, and soon foreign
commercial interests were permitted, in a restricted way, to enter the
country. Then with the separation of Mexico and the other American
colonies from Spain a more marked change was brought about in that
direct communication was established with the mother country, and the
absolutism of the hagiarchy first questioned by the numbers of
Peninsular Spaniards who entered the islands to trade, some even to
settle and rear families there. These also affected the native
population in the larger centers by the spread of their ideas, which
were not always in conformity with those that for several centuries the
friars had been inculcating into their wards. Moreover, there was a
not-inconsiderable portion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e268"
href="#xd24e268" name="xd24e268">xiv</a>]</span>of the population,
sprung from the friars themselves, who were eager to adopt the customs
and ideas of the Spanish immigrants.</p>
<p class="par">The suppression of many of the monasteries in Spain in
1835 caused a large influx of the disestablished monks into the
Philippines in search for a haven, and a home, thus bringing about a
conflict with the native clergy, who were displaced from their best
holdings to provide berths for the newcomers. At the same time, the
increase of education among the native priests brought the natural
demand for more equitable treatment by the Spanish friar, so insistent
that it even broke out into open rebellion in 1843 on the part of a
young Tagalog who thought himself aggrieved in this respect.</p>
<p class="par">Thus the struggle went on, with stagnation above and
some growth below, so that the governors were ever getting further away
from the governed, and for such a movement there is in the course of
nature but one inevitable result, especially when outside influences
are actively at work penetrating the social system and making for
better things. Among these influences four cumulative ones may be
noted: the spread of journalism, the introduction of steamships into
the Philippines, the return of the Jesuits, and the opening of the Suez
Canal.</p>
<p class="par">The printing-press entered the islands with the
conquest, but its use had been strictly confined to religious works
until about the middle of the past century, when there was a sudden
awakening and within a few years five journals were being published. In
1848 appeared the first regular newspaper of importance, <i lang=
"es">El Diario de Manila</i>, and about a decade later the principal
organ of the Spanish-Filipino population, <i lang="es">El Comercio</i>,
which, with varying vicissitudes, has continued down to the present.
While rigorously censored, both politically and religiously, and
accessible to only an infinitesimal portion of the people, they still
performed the service of letting a few rays of light into the Cimmerian
intellectual gloom of the time and place.</p>
<p class="par">With the coming of steam navigation communication
between the different parts of the islands was facilitated and trade
encouraged, with all that such a change meant in the way of breaking up
the old isolation and tending to a common understanding. Spanish power,
too, was for the moment more firmly established, and Moro piracy in
Luzon and the Bisayan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e285" href=
"#xd24e285" name="xd24e285">xv</a>]</span>Islands, which had been so
great a drawback to the development of the country, was forever
ended.</p>
<p class="par">The return of the Jesuits produced two general results
tending to dissatisfaction with the existing order. To them was
assigned the missionary field of Mindanao, which meant the displacement
of the Recollect Fathers in the missions there, and for these other
berths had to be found. Again the native clergy were the losers in that
they had to give up their best parishes in Luzon, especially around
Manila and Cavite, so the breach was further widened and the soil sown
with discontent. But more far-reaching than this immediate result was
the educational movement inaugurated by the Jesuits. The native,
already feeling the vague impulses from without and stirred by the
growing restlessness of the times, here saw a new world open before
him. A considerable portion of the native population in the larger
centers, who had shared in the economic progress of the colony, were
enabled to look beyond their daily needs and to afford their children
an opportunity for study and advancement&mdash;a condition and a need
met by the Jesuits for a time.</p>
<p class="par">With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 communication
with the mother country became cheaper, quicker, surer, so that large
numbers of Spaniards, many of them in sympathy with the republican
movements at home, came to the Philippines in search of fortunes and
generally left half-caste families who had imbibed their ideas. Native
boys who had already felt the intoxication of such learning as the
schools of Manila afforded them began to dream of greater wonders in
Spain, now that the journey was possible for them. So began the
definite movements that led directly to the disintegration of the friar
r&eacute;gime.</p>
<p class="par">In the same year occurred the revolution in the mother
country, which had tired of the old corrupt despotism. Isabella II was
driven into exile and the country left to waver about uncertainly for
several years, passing through all the stages of government from red
radicalism to absolute conservatism, finally adjusting itself to the
middle course of constitutional monarchism. During the effervescent and
ephemeral republic there was sent to the Philippines a governor who set
to work to modify the old system and establish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e293" href="#xd24e293" name=
"xd24e293">xvi</a>]</span>a government more in harmony with modern
ideas and more democratic in form. His changes were hailed with delight
by the growing class of Filipinos who were striving for more
consideration in their own country, and who, in their enthusiasm and
the intoxication of the moment, perhaps became more radical than was
safe under the conditions&mdash;surely too radical for their religious
guides watching and waiting behind the veil of the temple.</p>
<p class="par">In January, 1872, an uprising occurred in the naval
arsenal at Cavite, with a Spanish non-commissioned officer as one of
the leaders. From the meager evidence now obtainable, this would seem
to have been purely a local mutiny over the service questions of pay
and treatment, but in it the friars saw their opportunity. It was
blazoned forth, with all the wild panic that was to characterize the
actions of the governing powers from that time on, as the premature
outbreak of a general insurrection under the leadership of the native
clergy, and rigorous repressive measures were demanded. Three native
priests, notable for their popularity among their own people, one an
octogenarian and the other two young canons of the Manila Cathedral,
were summarily garroted, along with the renegade Spanish officer who
had participated in the mutiny. No record of any trial of these priests
has ever been brought to light. The Archbishop, himself a
secular<a class="noteref" id="xd24e297src" href="#xd24e297" name=
"xd24e297src">5</a> clergyman, stoutly refused to degrade them from
their holy office, and they wore their sacerdotal robes at the
execution, which was conducted in a hurried, fearful manner. At the
same time a number of young Manilans who had taken conspicuous part in
the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; demonstrations were deported to the Ladrone
Islands or to remote islands of the Philippine group itself.</p>
<p class="par">This was the beginning of the end. Yet there immediately
followed the delusive calm which ever precedes the fatal outburst,
lulling those marked for destruction to a delusive security. The two
decades following were years of quiet, unobtrusive growth, during which
the Philippine Islands made the greatest economic progress in their
history. But this in itself was preparing the final catastrophe, for if
there be any fact well established in human experience it is that with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e302" href="#xd24e302" name=
"xd24e302">xvii</a>]</span>economic development the power of organized
religion begins to wane&mdash;the rise of the merchant spells the
decline of the priest. A sordid change, from masses and mysteries to
sugar and shoes, this is often said to be, but it should be noted that
the epochs of greatest economic activity have been those during which
the generality of mankind have lived fuller and freer lives, and above
all that in such eras the finest intellects and the grandest souls have
been developed.</p>
<p class="par">Nor does an institution that has been slowly growing for
three centuries, molding the very life and fiber of the people,
disintegrate without a violent struggle, either in its own constitution
or in the life of the people trained under it. Not only the
ecclesiastical but also the social and political system of the country
was controlled by the religious orders, often silently and secretly,
but none the less effectively. This is evident from the ceaseless
conflict that went on between the religious orders and the Spanish
political administrators, who were at every turn thwarted in their
efforts to keep the government abreast of the times.</p>
<p class="par">The shock of the affair of 1872 had apparently stunned
the Filipinos, but it had at the same time brought them to the parting
of the ways and induced a vague feeling that there was something
radically wrong, which could only be righted by a closer union among
themselves. They began to consider that their interests and those of
the governing powers were not the same. In these feelings of distrust
toward the friars they were stimulated by the great numbers of
immigrant Spaniards who were then entering the country, many of whom
had taken part in the republican movements at home and who, upon the
restoration of the monarchy, no doubt thought it safer for them to be
at as great a distance as possible from the throne. The young Filipinos
studying in Spain came from different parts of the islands, and by
their association there in a foreign land were learning to forget their
narrow sectionalism; hence the way was being prepared for some
concerted action. Thus, aided and encouraged by the anti-clerical
Spaniards in the mother country, there was growing up a new generation
of native leaders, who looked toward something better than the old
system.</p>
<p class="par">It is with this period in the history of the
country&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e310" href=
"#xd24e310" name="xd24e310">xviii</a>]</span>author&rsquo;s
boyhood&mdash;that the story of <i lang="es">Noli Me Tangere</i> deals.
Typical scenes and characters are sketched from life with wonderful
accuracy, and the picture presented is that of a master-mind, who knew
and loved his subject. Terror and repression were the order of the day,
with ever a growing unrest in the higher circles, while the native
population at large seemed to be completely
<i>cowed</i>&mdash;&ldquo;brutalized&rdquo; is the term repeatedly used
by Rizal in his political essays. Spanish writers of the period,
observing only the superficial movements,&mdash;some of which were
indeed fantastical enough, for</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd24e320">&ldquo;they,</p>
<p class="line">Who in oppression&rsquo;s darkness caved have
dwelt,</p>
<p class="line">They are not eagles, nourished with the day;</p>
<p class="line">What marvel, then, at times, if they mistake their
way?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&mdash;and not heeding the currents at work below,
take great delight in ridiculing the pretensions of the young men
seeking advancement, while they indulge in coarse ribaldry over the
wretched condition of the great mass of the &ldquo;Indians.&rdquo; The
author, however, himself a &ldquo;miserable Indian,&rdquo; vividly
depicts the unnatural conditions and dominant characters produced under
the outworn system of fraud and force, at the same time presenting his
people as living, feeling, struggling individuals, with all the
frailties of human nature and all the possibilities of mankind, either
for good or evil; incidentally he throws into marked contrast the
despicable depreciation used by the Spanish writers in referring to the
Filipinos, making clear the application of the self-evident proposition
that no ordinary human being in the presence of superior force can very
well conduct himself as a man unless he be treated as such.</p>
<p class="par">The friar orders, deluded by their transient triumph and
secure in their pride of place, became more arrogant, more domineering
than ever. In the general administration the political rulers were at
every turn thwarted, their best efforts frustrated, and if they
ventured too far their own security threatened; for in the
three-cornered wrangle which lasted throughout the whole of the Spanish
domination, the friar orders had, in addition to the strength derived
from their organization and their wealth, the Damoclean weapon of
control over the natives to hang above the heads of both governor and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e332" href="#xd24e332" name=
"xd24e332">xix</a>]</span>archbishop. The curates in the towns, always
the real rulers, became veritable despots, so that no voice dared to
raise itself against them, even in the midst of conditions which the
humblest <i>indio</i> was beginning to feel dumbly to be perverted and
unnatural, and that, too, after three centuries of training under the
system that he had ever been taught to accept as &ldquo;the will of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The friars seemed long since to have forgotten those
noble aims that had meant so much to the founders and early workers of
their orders, if indeed the great majority of those of the later day
had ever realized the meaning of their office, for the Spanish writers
of the time delight in characterizing them as the meanest of the
Spanish peasantry, when not something worse, who had been
&ldquo;lassoed,&rdquo; taught a few ritualistic prayers, and shipped to
the Philippines to be placed in isolated towns as lords and masters of
the native population, with all the power and prestige over a docile
people that the sacredness of their holy office gave them. These
writers treat the matter lightly, seeing in it rather a huge joke on
the &ldquo;miserable Indians,&rdquo; and give the friars great credit
for &ldquo;patriotism,&rdquo; a term which in this connection they
dragged from depth to depth until it quite aptly fitted Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s famous definition, &ldquo;the last refuge of a
scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In their conduct the religious corporations, both as
societies and as individuals, must be estimated according to their own
standards&mdash;the application of any other criterion would be
palpably unfair. They undertook to hold the native in subjection, to
regulate the essential activities of his life according to their ideas,
so upon them must fall the responsibility for the conditions finally
attained: to destroy the freedom of the subject and then attempt to
blame him for his conduct is a paradox into which the learned men often
fell, perhaps inadvertently through their deductive logic. They
endeavored to shape the lives of their Malay wards not only in this
existence but also in the next. Their vows were poverty, chastity, and
obedience.</p>
<p class="par">The vow of poverty was early relegated to the limbo of
neglect. Only a few years after the founding of Manila royal decrees
began to issue on the subject of complaints received by the King over
the usurpation of lands on the part of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e343" href="#xd24e343" name=
"xd24e343">xx</a>]</span>priests. Using the same methods so familiar in
the heyday of the institution of monasticism in Europe&mdash;pious
gifts, deathbed bequests, pilgrims&rsquo; offerings&mdash;the friar
orders gradually secured the richest of the arable lands in the more
thickly settled portions of the Philippines, notably the part of Luzon
occupied by the Tagalogs. Not always, however, it must in justice be
recorded, were such doubtful means resorted to, for there were
instances where the missionary was the pioneer, gathering about himself
a band of devoted natives and plunging into the unsettled parts to
build up a town with its fields around it, which would later become a
friar estate. With the accumulated incomes from these estates and the
fees for religious observances that poured into their treasuries, the
orders in their nature of perpetual corporations became the masters of
the situation, the lords of the country. But this condition was not
altogether objectionable; it was in the excess of their greed that they
went astray, for the native peoples had been living under this system
through generations and not until they began to feel that they were not
receiving fair treatment did they question the authority of a power
which not only secured them a peaceful existence in this life but also
assured them eternal felicity in the next.</p>
<p class="par">With only the shining exceptions that are produced in
any system, no matter how false its premises or how decadent it may
become, to uphold faith in the intrinsic soundness of human nature, the
vow of chastity was never much more than a myth. Through the tremendous
influence exerted over a fanatically religious people, who implicitly
followed the teachings of the reverend fathers, once their confidence
had been secured, the curate was seldom to be gainsaid in his desires.
By means of the secret influence in the confessional and the more open
political power wielded by him, the fairest was his to command, and the
favored one and her people looked upon the choice more as an honor than
otherwise, for besides the social standing that it gave her there was
the proud prospect of becoming the mother of children who could claim
kinship with the dominant race. The curate&rsquo;s
&ldquo;companion&rdquo; or the sacristan&rsquo;s wife was a power in
the community, her family was raised to a place of importance and
influence among their own people, while she and her ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e347" href="#xd24e347" name=
"xd24e347">xxi</a>]</span>offspring were well cared for. On the death
or removal of the curate, it was almost invariably found that she had
been provided with a husband or protector and a not inconsiderable
amount of property&mdash;an arrangement rather appealing to a people
among whom the means of living have ever been so insecure.</p>
<p class="par">That this practise was not particularly offensive to the
people among whom they dwelt may explain the situation, but to claim
that it excuses the friars approaches dangerously close to casuistry.
Still, as long as this arrangement was decently and moderately carried
out, there seems to have been no great objection, nor from a worldly
point of view, with all the conditions considered, could there be much.
But the old story of excess, of unbridled power turned toward bad ends,
again recurs, at the same time that the ideas brought in by the
Spaniards who came each year in increasing numbers and the principles
observed by the young men studying in Europe cast doubt upon the
fitness of such a state of affairs. As they approached their downfall,
like all mankind, the friars became more open, more insolent, more
shameless, in their conduct.</p>
<p class="par">The story of Maria Clara, as told in <i lang="es">Noli
Me Tangere</i>, is by no means an exaggerated instance, but rather one
of the few clean enough to bear the light, and her fate, as depicted in
the epilogue, is said to be based upon an actual occurrence with which
the author must have been familiar.</p>
<p class="par">The vow of obedience&mdash;whether considered as to the
Pope, their highest religious authority, or to the King of Spain, their
political liege&mdash;might not always be so callously disregarded, but
it could be evaded and defied. From the Vatican came bull after bull,
from the Escorial decree after decree, only to be archived in Manila,
sometimes after a hollow pretense of compliance. A large part of the
records of Spanish domination is taken up with the wearisome quarrels
that went on between the Archbishop, representing the head of the
Church, and the friar orders, over the questions of the episcopal
visitation and the enforcement of the provisions of the Council of
Trent relegating the monks to their original status of missionaries,
with the friars invariably victorious in their contentions. Royal
decrees ordering inquiries into the titles to the estates of the men of
poverty and those providing for the education of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e358" href="#xd24e358" name=
"xd24e358">xxii</a>]</span>the natives in Spanish were merely sneered
at and left to molder in harmless quiet. Not without good grounds for
his contention, the friar claimed that the Spanish dominion over the
Philippines depended upon him, and he therefore confidently set himself
up as the best judge of how that dominion should be maintained.</p>
<p class="par">Thus there are presented in the Philippines of the
closing quarter of the century just past the phenomena so frequently
met with in modern societies, so disheartening to the people who must
drag out their lives under them, of an old system which has outworn its
usefulness and is being called into question, with forces actively at
work disintegrating it, yet with the unhappy folk bred and reared under
it unprepared for a new order of things. The old faith was breaking
down, its forms and beliefs, once so full of life and meaning, were
being sharply examined, doubt and suspicion were the order of the day.
Moreover, it must ever be borne in mind that in the Philippines this
unrest, except in the parts where the friars were the landlords, was
not general among the people, the masses of whom were still sunk in
their &ldquo;loved Egyptian night,&rdquo; but affected only a very
small proportion of the population&mdash;for the most part young men
who were groping their way toward something better, yet without any
very clearly conceived idea of what that better might be, and among
whom was to be found the usual sprinkling of &ldquo;sunshine
patriots&rdquo; and omnipresent opportunists ready for any kind of
trouble that will afford them a chance to rise.</p>
<p class="par">Add to the apathy of the masses dragging out their
vacant lives amid the shadows of religious superstition and to the
unrest of the few, the fact that the orders were in absolute control of
the political machinery of the country, with the best part of the
agrarian wealth amortized in their hands; add also the ever-present
jealousies, petty feuds, and racial hatreds, for which Manila and the
Philippines, with their medley of creeds and races, offer such a
fertile field, all fostered by the governing class for the maintenance
of the old Machiavelian principle of &ldquo;divide and rule,&rdquo; and
the sum is about the most miserable condition under which any portion
of mankind ever tried to fulfill nature&rsquo;s inexorable laws of
growth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e365" href="#xd24e365" name=

<p class="par first">&ldquo;Ah, simple people, how little do you know
the blessing that you enjoy! Neither hunger, nor nakedness, nor
inclemency of the weather troubles you. With the payment of seven reals
per year, you remain free of contributions. You do not have to close
your houses with bolts. You do not fear that the district troopers will
come in to lay waste your fields, and trample you under foot at your
own firesides. You call &lsquo;father&rsquo; the one who is in command
over you. Perhaps there will come a time when you will be more
civilized, and you will break out in revolution; and you will wake
terrified, at the tumult of the riots, and will see blood flowing
through these quiet fields, and gallows and guillotines erected in
these squares, which never yet have seen an execution.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e403src" href="#xd24e403" name="xd24e403src">6</a>
Thus moralized a Spanish traveler in 1842, just as that <i lang=
"es">dolce far niente</i> was drawing to its close. Already far-seeing
men had begun to raise in the Spanish parliament the question of the
future of the Philippines, looking toward some definite program for
their care under modern conditions and for the adjustment of their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e415" href="#xd24e415" name=
"xd24e415">xxiv</a>]</span>relations with the mother country. But these
were mere Cassandra-voices&mdash;the horologe of time was striking for
Rome&rsquo;s successor, as it did for Rome herself.</p>
<p class="par">Just where will come the outbreak after three centuries
of mind-repression and soul-distortion, of forcing a growing subject
into the strait-jacket of medieval thought and action, of natural
selection reversed by the constant elimination of native initiative and
leadership, is indeed a curious study. That there will be an outbreak
somewhere is as certain as that the plant will grow toward the light,
even under the most unfavorable conditions, for man&rsquo;s nature is
but the resultant of eternal forces that ceaselessly and irresistibly
interplay about and upon him, and somewhere this resultant will express
itself in thought or deed.</p>
<p class="par">After three centuries of Spanish ecclesiastical
domination in the Philippines, it was to be expected that the wards
would turn against their mentors the methods that had been used upon
them, nor is it especially remarkable that there was a decided tendency
in some parts to revert to primitive barbarism, but that concurrently a
creative genius&mdash;a bard or seer&mdash;should have been developed
among a people who, as a whole, have hardly passed through the clan or
village stage of society, can be regarded as little less than a
psychological phenomenon, and provokes the perhaps presumptuous inquiry
as to whether there may not be some things about our common human
nature that the learned doctors have not yet included in their
anthropometric diagrams.</p>
<p class="par">On the western shore of the Lake of Bay in the heart of
the Philippines clusters the village of Kalamba, first established by
the Jesuit Fathers in the early days of the conquest, and upon their
expulsion in 1767 taken over by the Crown, which later transferred it
to the Dominicans, under whose care the fertile fields about it became
one of the richest of the friar estates. It can hardly be called a
town, even for the Philippines, but is rather a market-village, set as
it is at the outlet of the rich country of northern Batangas on the
open waterway to Manila and the outside world. Around it flourish the
green rice-fields, while Mount Makiling towers majestically near in her
moods of cloud and sunshine, overlooking the picturesque curve of the
shore and the rippling waters of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e423" href="#xd24e423" name="xd24e423">xxv</a>]</span>lake.
Shadowy to the eastward gleam the purple crests of Banahao and
Cristobal, and but a few miles to the southwestward dim-thundering,
seething, earth-rocking Taal mutters and moans of the world&rsquo;s
birth-throes. It is the center of a region rich in native lore and
legend, as it sleeps through the dusty noons when the cacao leaves
droop with the heat and dreams through the silvery nights, waking twice
or thrice a week to the endless babble and ceaseless chatter of an
Oriental market where the noisy throngs make of their trading as much a
matter of pleasure and recreation as of business.</p>
<p class="par">Directly opposite this market-place, in a house facing
the village church, there was born in 1861 into the already large
family of one of the more prosperous tenants on the Dominican estate a
boy who was to combine in his person the finest traits of the Oriental
character with the best that Spanish and European culture could add, on
whom would fall the burden of his people&rsquo;s woes to lead him over
the <i lang="la">via dolorosa</i> of struggle and sacrifice, ending in
his own destruction amid the crumbling ruins of the system whose
disintegration he himself had done so much to compass.</p>
<p class="par">Jos&eacute; Rizal-Mercado y Alonso, as his name emerges
from the confusion of Filipino nomenclature, was of Malay extraction,
with some distant strains of Spanish and Chinese blood. His genealogy
reveals several persons remarkable for intellect and independence of
character, notably a Philippine Eloise and Abelard, who, drawn together
by their common enthusiasm for study and learning, became his maternal
grandparents, as well as a great-uncle who was a traveler and student
and who directed the boy&rsquo;s early studies. Thus from the beginning
his training was exceptional, while his mind was stirred by the trouble
already brewing in his community, and from the earliest hours of
consciousness he saw about him the wrongs and injustices which
overgrown power will ever develop in dealing with a weaker subject. One
fact of his childhood, too, stands out clearly, well worthy of record:
his mother seems to have been a woman of more than ordinary education
for the time and place, and, pleased with the boy&rsquo;s quick
intelligence, she taught him to read Spanish from a copy of the Vulgate
in that language, which she had somehow managed to secure and keep in
her possession&mdash;the old, old <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e432" href="#xd24e432" name="xd24e432">xxvi</a>]</span>story of
the Woman and the Book, repeated often enough under strange
circumstances, but under none stranger than these. The boy&rsquo;s
father was well-to-do, so he was sent at the age of eight to study in
the new Jesuit school in Manila, not however before he had already
inspired some awe in his simple neighbors by the facility with which he
composed verses in his native tongue.</p>
<p class="par">He began his studies in a private house while waiting
for an opportunity to enter the Ateneo, as the Jesuit school is called,
and while there he saw one of his tutors, Padre Burgos, haled to an
ignominious death on the garrote as a result of the affair of 1872.
This made a deep impression on his childish mind and, in fact, seems to
have been one of the principal factors in molding his ideas and shaping
his career. That the effect upon him was lasting and that his later
judgment confirmed him in the belief that a great injustice had been
done, are shown by the fact that his second important work, <i lang=
"es">El Filibusterismo</i>, written about 1891, and miscalled by
himself a &ldquo;novel,&rdquo; for it is really a series of
word-paintings constituting a terrific arraignment of the whole
r&eacute;gime, was dedicated to the three priests executed in 1872, in
these words: &ldquo;Religion, in refusing to degrade you, has placed in
doubt the crime imputed to you; the government, in surrounding your
case with mystery and shadow, gives reason for belief in some error,
committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, in venerating your
memory and calling you martyrs, in no way acknowledges your
guilt.&rdquo; The only answer he ever received to this was eight
Remington bullets fired into his back.</p>
<p class="par">In the Ateneo he quickly attracted attention and became
a general favorite by his application to his studies, the poetic fervor
with which he entered into all the exercises of religious devotion, and
the gentleness of his character. He was from the first considered
&ldquo;peculiar,&rdquo; for so the common mind regards everything that
fails to fit the old formulas, being of a rather dreamy and reticent
disposition, more inclined to reading Spanish romances than joining in
the games of his schoolmates. And of all the literatures that could be
placed in the hands of an imaginative child, what one would be more
productive in a receptive mind of a fervid love of life and home and
country and all that men hold dear, than that of the musical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e441" href="#xd24e441" name=
"xd24e441">xxvii</a>]</span>language of Castile, with its high coloring
and passionate character?</p>
<p class="par">His activities were varied, for, in addition to his
regular studies, he demonstrated considerable skill in wood-carving and
wax-modeling, and during this period won several prizes for poetical
compositions in Spanish, which, while sometimes juvenile in form and
following closely after Spanish models, reveal at times flashes of
thought and turns of expression that show distinct originality; even in
these early compositions there is that plaintive undertone, that minor
chord of sadness, which pervades all his poems, reaching its fullest
measure of pathos in the verses written in his death-cell. He received
a bachelor&rsquo;s degree according to the Spanish system in 1877, but
continued advanced studies in agriculture at the Ateneo, at the same
time that he was pursuing the course in philosophy in the Dominican
University of Santo Tomas, where in 1879 he startled the learned
doctors by a reference in a prize poem to the Philippines as his
&ldquo;patria,&rdquo; fatherland. This political heresy on the part of
a native of the islands was given no very serious attention at the
time, being looked upon as the vagary of a schoolboy, but again in the
following year, by what seems a strange fatality, he stirred the
resentment of the friars, especially the Dominicans, by winning over
some of their number the first prize in a literary contest celebrated
in honor of the author of <i>Don Quixote</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The archaic instruction in Santo Tomas soon disgusted
him and led to disagreements with the instructors, and he turned to
Spain. Plans for his journey and his stay there had to be made with the
utmost caution, for it would hardly have fared well with his family had
it become known that the son of a tenant on an estate which was a part
of the University endowment was studying in Europe. He reached Spanish
territory first in Barcelona, the hotbed of radicalism, where he heard
a good deal of revolutionary talk, which, however, seems to have made
but little impression upon him, for throughout his entire career
breadth of thought and strength of character are revealed in his
consistent opposition to all forms of violence.</p>
<p class="par">In Madrid he pursued the courses in medicine and
philosophy, but a fact of even more consequence than his proficiency in
his regular work was his persistent study of languages and his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e453" href="#xd24e453" name=
"xd24e453">xxviii</a>]</span>omnivorous reading. He was associated with
the other Filipinos who were working in a somewhat spectacular way,
misdirected rather than led by what may be styled the Spanish liberals,
for more considerate treatment of the Philippines. But while he was
among them he was not of them, as his studious habits and reticent
disposition would hardly have made him a favorite among those who were
enjoying the broader and gayer life there. Moreover, he soon advanced
far beyond them in thought by realizing that they were beginning at the
wrong end of the labor, for even at that time he seems to have caught,
by what must almost be looked upon as an inspiration of genius, since
there was nothing apparent in his training that would have suggested
it, the realization of the fact that hope for his people lay in
bettering their condition, that any real benefit must begin with the
benighted folk at home, that the introduction of reforms for which they
were unprepared would be useless, even dangerous to them. This was not
at all the popular idea among his associates and led to serious
disagreements with their leaders, for it was the way of toil and
sacrifice without any of the excitement and glamour that came from
drawing up magnificent plans and sending them back home with appeals
for funds to carry on the propaganda&mdash;for the most part banquets
and entertainments to Spain&rsquo;s political leaders.</p>
<p class="par">His views, as revealed in his purely political writings,
may be succinctly stated, for he had that faculty of expression which
never leaves any room for doubt as to the meaning. His people had a
natural right to grow and to develop, and any obstacles to such growth
and development were to be removed. He realized that the masses of his
countrymen were sunk deep in poverty and ignorance, cringing and
crouching before political authority, crawling and groveling before
religious superstition, but to him this was no subject for jest or
indifferent neglect&mdash;it was a serious condition which should be
ameliorated, and hope lay in working into the inert social mass the
leaven of conscious individual effort toward the development of a
distinctive, responsible personality. He was profoundly appreciative of
all the good that Spain had done, but saw in this no inconsistency with
the desire that this gratitude might be given cause to be ever on the
increase, thereby uniting the Philippines with the mother country by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e457" href="#xd24e457" name=
"xd24e457">xxix</a>]</span>the firm bonds of common ideas and
interests, for his earlier writings breathe nothing but admiration,
respect, and loyalty for Spain and her more advanced institutions. The
issue was clear to him and he tried to keep it so.</p>
<p class="par">It was indeed administrative myopia, induced largely by
blind greed, which allowed the friar orders to confuse the objections
to their repressive system with an attack upon Spanish sovereignty,
thereby dragging matters from bad to worse, to engender ill feeling and
finally desperation. This narrow, selfish policy had about as much
soundness in it as the idea upon which it was based, so often brought
forward with what looks very suspiciously like a specious effort to
cover mental indolence with a glittering generality, &ldquo;that the
Filipino is only a grown-up child and needs a strong paternal
government,&rdquo; an idea which entirely overlooks the natural fact
that when an impressionable subject comes within the influence of a
stronger force from a higher civilization he is very likely to remain a
child&mdash;perhaps a stunted one&mdash;as long as he is treated as
such. There is about as much sense and justice in such logic as there
would be in that of keeping a babe confined in swaddling-bands and then
blaming it for not knowing how to walk. No creature will remain a
healthy child forever, but, as Spain learned to her bitter cost, will
be very prone, as the parent grows decrepit and it begins to feel its
strength, to prove a troublesome subject to handle, thereby reversing
the natural law suggested by the comparison, and bringing such
Sancho-Panza statecraft to flounder at last through as hopeless
confusion to as absurd a conclusion as his own island government.</p>
<p class="par">Rizal was not one of those rabid, self-seeking
revolutionists who would merely overthrow the government and maintain
the old system with themselves in the privileged places of the former
rulers, nor is he to be classed among the misguided enthusiasts who by
their intemperate demands and immoderate conduct merely strengthen the
hands of those in power. He realized fully that the restrictions under
which the people had become accustomed to order their lives should be
removed gradually as they advanced under suitable guidance and became
capable of adjusting themselves to the new and better conditions. They
should take all the good offered, from any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e463" href="#xd24e463" name=
"xd24e463">xxx</a>]</span>source, especially that suited to their
nature, which they could properly assimilate. No great patience was
ever exhibited by him toward those of his countrymen&mdash;the most
repulsive characters in his stories are such&mdash;who would make of
themselves mere apes and mimes, decorating themselves with a veneer of
questionable alien characteristics, but with no personality or
stability of their own, presenting at best a spectacle to make devils
laugh and angels weep, lacking even the hothouse product&rsquo;s virtue
of being good to look upon.</p>
<p class="par">Reduced to a definite form, the wish of the more
thoughtful in the new generation of Filipino leaders that was growing
up was that the Philippine Islands be made a province of Spain with
representation in the Cortes and the concomitant freedom of expression
and criticism. All that was directly asked was some substantial
participation in the management of local affairs, and the curtailment
of the arbitrary power of petty officials, especially of the friar
curates, who constituted the chief obstacle to the education and
development of the people.</p>
<p class="par">The friar orders were, however, all-powerful, not only
in the Philippines, but also in Madrid, where they were not chary of
making use of a part of their wealth to maintain their influence. The
efforts of the Filipinos in Spain, while closely watched, do not seem
to have been given any very serious attention, for the Spanish
authorities no doubt realized that as long as the young men stayed in
Madrid writing manifestoes in a language which less than one per cent
of their countrymen could read and spending their money on members of
the Cortes, there could be little danger of trouble in the Philippines.
Moreover, the Spanish ministers themselves appear to have been in
sympathy with the more moderate wishes of the Filipinos, a fact
indicated by the number of changes ordered from time to time in the
Philippine administration, but they were powerless before the strength
and local influence of the religious orders. So matters dragged their
weary way along until there was an unexpected and startling
development, a David-Goliath contest, and certainly no one but a genius
could have polished the &ldquo;smooth stone&rdquo; that was to smite
the giant.</p>
<p class="par">It is said that the idea of writing a novel depicting
conditions in his native land first came to Rizal from a perusal of
Eugene <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e471" href="#xd24e471" name=
"xd24e471">xxxi</a>]</span>Sue&rsquo;s <i>The Wandering Jew</i>, while
he was a student in Madrid, although the model for the greater part of
it is plainly the delectable sketches in <i>Don Quixote</i>, for the
author himself possessed in a remarkable degree that Cervantic touch
which raises the commonplace, even the mean, into the highest regions
of art. Not, however, until he had spent some time in Paris continuing
his medical studies, and later in Germany, did anything definite
result. But in 1887 <i lang="es">Noli Me Tangere</i> was printed in
Berlin, in an establishment where the author is said to have worked
part of his time as a compositor in order to defray his expenses while
he continued his studies. A limited edition was published through the
financial aid extended by a Filipino associate, and sent to Hongkong,
thence to be surreptitiously introduced into the Philippines.</p>
<p class="par"><i lang="es">Noli Me Tangere</i> (&ldquo;Touch Me
Not&rdquo;) at the time the work was written had a peculiar fitness as
a title. Not only was there an apt suggestion of a comparison with the
common flower of that name, but the term is also applied in pathology
to a malignant cancer which affects every bone and tissue in the body,
and that this latter was in the author&rsquo;s mind would appear from
the dedication and from the summing-up of the Philippine situation in
the final conversation between Ibarra and Elias. But in a letter
written to a friend in Paris at the time, the author himself says that
it was taken from the Gospel scene where the risen Savior appears to
the Magdalene, to whom He addresses these words, a scene that has been
the subject of several notable paintings.</p>
<p class="par">In this connection it is interesting to note what he
himself thought of the work, and his frank statement of what he had
tried to accomplish, made just as he was publishing it: &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Noli Me Tangere</i>, an expression taken from the Gospel of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Luke,<a class="noteref" id=

time has spoken, for they are so sensitive that they have never
suffered themselves to be touched by any one whomsoever. For my own
part, I have attempted to do what no one else has been willing to do: I
have dared to answer the calumnies that have for centuries been heaped
upon us and our country. I have written of the social condition and the
life, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e505" href="#xd24e505" name=
"xd24e505">xxxii</a>]</span>of our beliefs, our hopes, our longings,
our complaints, and our sorrows; I have unmasked the hypocrisy which,
under the cloak of religion, has come among us to impoverish and to
brutalize us, I have distinguished the true religion from the false,
from the superstition that traffics with the holy word to get money and
to make us believe in absurdities for which Catholicism would blush, if
ever it knew of them. I have unveiled that which has been hidden behind
the deceptive and dazzling words of our governments. I have told our
countrymen of our mistakes, our vices, our faults, and our weak
complaisance with our miseries there. Where I have found virtue I have
spoken of it highly in order to render it homage; and if I have not
wept in speaking of our misfortunes, I have laughed over them, for no
one would wish to weep with me over our woes, and laughter is ever the
best means of concealing sorrow. The deeds that I have related are true
and have actually occurred; I can furnish proof of this. My book may
have (and it does have) defects from an artistic and esthetic point of
view&mdash;this I do not deny&mdash;but no one can dispute the veracity
of the facts presented.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e508src" href=
"#xd24e508" name="xd24e508src">8</a></p>
<p class="par">But while the primary purpose and first effect of the
work was to crystallize anti-friar sentiment, the author has risen
above a mere personal attack, which would give it only a temporary
value, and by portraying in so clear and sympathetic a way the life of
his people has produced a piece of real literature, of especial
interest now as they are being swept into the newer day. Any fool can
point out errors and defects, if they are at all apparent, and the
persistent searching them out for their own sake is the surest mark of
the vulpine mind, but the author has east aside all such petty
considerations and, whether consciously or not, has left a work of
permanent value to his own people and of interest to all friends of
humanity. If ever a fair land has been cursed with the wearisome breed
of fault-finders, both indigenous and exotic, that land is the
Philippines, so it is indeed refreshing to turn from the dreary waste
of carping criticisms, pragmatical &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; analyses,
and sneering half-truths to a story pulsating with life, presenting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e516" href="#xd24e516" name=
"xd24e516">xxxiii</a>]</span>the Filipino as a human being, with his
virtues and his vices, his loves and hates, his hopes and fears.</p>
<p class="par">The publication of <i lang="es">Noli Me Tangere</i>
suggests the reflection that the story of Achilles&rsquo; heel is a
myth only in form. The belief that any institution, system,
organization, or arrangement has reached an absolute form is about as
far as human folly can go. The friar orders looked upon themselves as
the sum of human achievement in man-driving and God-persuading,
divinely appointed to rule, fixed in their power, far above suspicion.
Yet they were obsessed by the sensitive, covert dread of exposure that
ever lurks spectrally under pharisaism&rsquo;s specious robe, so when
there appeared this work of a &ldquo;miserable Indian,&rdquo; who dared
to portray them and the conditions that their control produced exactly
as they were&mdash;for the indefinable touch by which the author gives
an air of unimpeachable veracity to his story is perhaps its greatest
artistic merit&mdash;the effect upon the mercurial Spanish temperament
was, to say the least, electric. The very audacity of the thing left
the friars breathless.</p>
<p class="par">A committee of learned doctors from Santo Tomas, who
were appointed to examine the work, unmercifully scored it as attacking
everything from the state religion to the integrity of the Spanish
dominions, so the circulation of it in the Philippines was, of course,
strictly prohibited, which naturally made the demand for it greater.
Large sums were paid for single copies, of which, it might be remarked
in passing, the author himself received scarcely any part; collections
have ever had a curious habit of going astray in the Philippines.</p>
<p class="par">Although the possession of a copy by a Filipino usually
meant summary imprisonment or deportation, often with the concomitant
confiscation of property for the benefit of some &ldquo;patriot,&rdquo;
the book was widely read among the leading families and had the desired
effect of crystallizing the sentiment against the friars, thus to pave
the way for concerted action. At last the idol had been flouted, so all
could attack it. Within a year after it had begun to circulate in the
Philippines a memorial was presented to the Archbishop by quite a
respectable part of the Filipinos in Manila, requesting that the friar
orders be expelled from the country, but this resulted only in the
deportation of every signer of the petition upon whom the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e528" href="#xd24e528" name=
"xd24e528">xxxiv</a>]</span>government could lay hands. They were
scattered literally to the four corners of the earth: some to the
Ladrone Islands, some to Fernando Po off the west coast of Africa, some
to Spanish prisons, others to remote parts of the Philippines.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, the author had returned to the Philippines
for a visit to his family, during which time he was constantly attended
by an officer of the Civil Guard, detailed ostensibly as a body-guard.
All his movements were closely watched, and after a few months the
Captain-General &ldquo;advised&rdquo; him to leave the country, at the
same time requesting a copy of <i lang="es">Noli Me Tangere</i>, saying
that the excerpts submitted to him by the censor had awakened a desire
to read the entire work. Rizal returned to Europe by way of Japan and
the United States, which did not seem to make any distinct impression
upon him, although it was only a little later that he predicted that
when Spain lost control of the Philippines, an eventuality he seemed to
consider certain not far in the future, the United States would be a
probable successor.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e535src" href="#xd24e535"
name="xd24e535src">9</a></p>
<p class="par">Returning to Europe, he spent some time in London
preparing an edition of Morga&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Sucesos de las
Filipinas</i>, a work published in Mexico about 1606 by the principal
actor in some of the most stirring scenes of the formative period of
the Philippine government. It is a record of prime importance in
Philippine history, and the resuscitation of it was no small service to
the country. Rizal added notes tending to show that the Filipinos had
been possessed of considerable culture and civilization before the
Spanish conquest, and he even intimated that they had retrograded
rather than advanced under Spanish tutelage. But such an extreme view
must be ascribed to patriotic ardor, for Rizal himself, though
possessed of that intangible quality commonly known as genius and
partly trained in northern Europe, is still in his own personality the
strongest refutation of such a contention.</p>
<p class="par">Later, in Ghent, he published <i lang="es">El
Filibusterismo</i>, called by him a continuation of <i lang="es">Noli
Me Tangere</i>, but with which it really has no more connection than
that some of the characters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e556"
href="#xd24e556" name="xd24e556">xxxv</a>]</span>reappear and are
disposed of.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e558src" href="#xd24e558" name=
"xd24e558src">10</a> There is almost no connected plot in it and hardly
any action, but there is the same incisive character-drawing and clear
etching of conditions that characterize the earlier work. It is a
maturer effort and a more forceful political argument, hence it lacks
the charm and simplicity which assign <i lang="es">Noli Me Tangere</i>
to a preeminent place in Philippine literature. The light satire of the
earlier work is replaced by bitter sarcasm delivered with deliberate
intent, for the iron had evidently entered his soul with broadening
experience and the realization that justice at the hands of decadent
Spain had been an iridescent dream of his youth. Nor had the Spanish
authorities in the Philippines been idle; his relatives had been
subjected to all the annoyances and irritations of petty persecution,
eventually losing the greater part of their property, while some of
them suffered deportation.</p>
<p class="par">In 1891 he returned to Hongkong to practise medicine, in
which profession he had remarkable success, even coming to be looked
upon as a wizard by his simple countrymen, among whom circulated
wonderful accounts of his magical powers. He was especially skilled in
ophthalmology, and his first operation after returning from his studies
in Europe was to restore his mother&rsquo;s sight by removing a
cataract from one of her eyes, an achievement which no doubt formed the
basis of marvelous tales. But the misfortunes of his people were ever
the paramount consideration, so he wrote to the Captain-General
requesting permission to remove his numerous relatives to Borneo to
establish a colony there, for which purpose liberal concessions had
been offered him by the British government. The request was denied, and
further stigmatized as an &ldquo;unpatriotic&rdquo; attempt to lessen
the population of the Philippines, when labor was already scarce. This
was the answer he received to a reasonable petition after the homes of
his family, including his own birthplace, had been ruthlessly destroyed
by military force, while a quarrel over ownership and rents was still
pending in the courts. The Captain-General at the time was Valeriano
Weyler, the pitiless instrument of the reactionary forces manipulated
by the monastic orders, he who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e572"
href="#xd24e572" name="xd24e572">xxxvi</a>]</span>was later sent to
Cuba to introduce there the repressive measures which had apparently
been so efficacious in the Philippines, thus to bring on the
interference of the United States to end Spain&rsquo;s colonial
power&mdash;all of which induces the reflection that there may still be
deluded casuists who doubt the reality of Nemesis.</p>
<p class="par">Weyler was succeeded by Eulogio Despujols, who made
sincere attempts to reform the administration, and was quite popular
with the Filipinos. In reply to repeated requests from Rizal to be
permitted to return to the Philippines unmolested a passport was
finally granted to him and he set out for Manila. For this move on his
part, in addition to the natural desire to be among his own people, two
special reasons appear: he wished to investigate and stop if possible
the unwarranted use of his name in taking up collections that always
remained mysteriously unaccounted for, and he was drawn by a ruse
deliberately planned and executed in that his mother was several times
officiously arrested and hustled about as a common criminal in order to
work upon the son&rsquo;s filial feelings and thus get him back within
reach of the Spanish authority, which, as subsequent events and later
researches have shown, was the real intention in issuing the passport.
Entirely unsuspecting any ulterior motive, however, in a few days after
his arrival he convoked a motley gathering of Filipinos of all grades
of the population, for he seems to have been only slightly acquainted
among his own people and not at all versed in the mazy Walpurgis dance
of Philippine politics, and laid before it the constitution for a
<i lang="es">Liga Filipina</i> (Philippine League), an organization
looking toward greater unity among the Filipinos and co&ouml;peration
for economic progress. This <i lang="es">Liga</i> was no doubt the
result of his observations in England and Germany, and, despite its
questionable form as a secret society for political and economic
purposes, was assuredly a step in the right direction, but
unfortunately its significance was beyond the comprehension of his
countrymen, most of whom saw in it only an opportunity for harassing
the Spanish government, for which all were ready enough.</p>
<p class="par">All his movements were closely watched, and a few days
after his return he was arrested on the charge of having seditious
literature in his baggage. The friars were already <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e584" href="#xd24e584" name=
"xd24e584">xxxvii</a>]</span>clamoring for his blood, but Despujols
seems to have been more in sympathy with Rizal than with the men whose
tool he found himself forced to be. Without trial Rizal was ordered
deported to Dapitan, a small settlement on the northern coast of
Mindanao. The decree ordering this deportation and the destruction of
all copies of his books to be found in the Philippines is a marvel of
sophistry, since, in the words of a Spanish writer of the time,
&ldquo;in this document we do not know which to wonder at most: the
ingenuousness of the Governor-General, for in this decree he implicitly
acknowledges his weakness and proneness to error, or the candor of
Rizal, who believed that all the way was strewn with
roses.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e586src" href="#xd24e586" name=
"xd24e586src">11</a> But it is quite evident that Despujols was playing
a double game, of which he seems to have been rather ashamed, for he
gave strict orders that copies of the decree should be withheld from
Rizal.</p>
<p class="par">In Dapitan Rizal gave himself up to his studies and such
medical practice as sought him out in that remote spot, for the fame of
his skill was widely extended, and he was allowed to live unmolested
under parole that he would make no attempt to escape. In company with a
Jesuit missionary he gathered about him a number of native boys and
conducted a practical school on the German plan, at the same time
indulging in religious polemics with his Jesuit acquaintances by
correspondence and working fitfully on some compositions which were
never completed, noteworthy among them being a study in English of the
Tagalog verb.</p>
<p class="par">But while he was living thus quietly in Dapitan, events
that were to determine his fate were misshaping themselves in Manila.
The stone had been loosened on the mountain-side and was bounding on in
mad career, far beyond his control. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">Reason and moderation in the person of Rizal
scorned and banished, the spirit of Jean Paul Marat and John Brown of
Ossawatomie rises to the fore in the shape of one Andres Bonifacio,
warehouse porter, who sits up o&rsquo; nights copying all the letters
and documents that he can lay hands on; composing grandiloquent
manifestoes in Tagalog; drawing up magnificent appointments in the
names of prominent persons who would later suffer even to the shedding
of their life&rsquo;s blood through his mania for writing history in
advance; spelling out Spanish tales of the French Revolution; babbling
of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity; hinting darkly to his confidants
that the President of France had begun life as a blacksmith. Only a few
days after Rizal was so summarily hustled away, Bonifacio gathered
together a crowd of malcontents and ignorant dupes, some of them
composing as choice a gang of cutthroats as ever slit the gullet of a
Chinese or tied mutilated prisoners in ant hills, and solemnly
organized the <i lang="tl">Kataastaasang Kagalang-galang Katipunan
ng&#771; mga Anak ng&#771; Bayan</i>, &ldquo;Supreme Select Association
of the Sons of the People,&rdquo; for the extermination of the ruling
race and the restoration of the Golden Age. It was to bring the people
into concerted action for a general revolt on a fixed date, when they
would rise simultaneously, take possession of the city of Manila,
and&mdash;the rest were better left to the imagination, for they had
been reared under the Spanish colonial system and imitativeness has
ever been pointed out as a cardinal trait in the Filipino character. No
quarter was to be asked or given, and the most sacred ties, even
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e620" href="#xd24e620" name=
"xd24e620">xxxix</a>]</span>of consanguinity, were to be disregarded in
the general slaughter. To the inquiry of a curious neophyte as to how
the Spaniards were to be distinguished from the other Europeans, in
order to avoid international complications, dark Andres replied that in
case of doubt they should proceed with due caution but should take good
care that they made no mistakes about letting any of the <i lang=
"es">Castilas</i> escape their vengeance. The higher officials of the
government were to be taken alive as hostages, while the friars were to
be reserved for a special holocaust on Bagumbayan Field, where over
their incinerated remains a heaven-kissing monument would be
erected.</p>
<p class="par">This Katipunan seems to have been an outgrowth from
Spanish freemasonry, introduced into the Philippines by a Spaniard
named Morayta and Marcelo H. del Pilar, a native of Bulacan Province
who was the practical leader of the Filipinos in Spain, but who died
there in 1896 just as he was setting out for Hongkong to mature his
plans for a general uprising to expel the friar orders. There had been
some masonic societies in the islands for some time, but the membership
had been limited to Peninsulars, and they played no part in the
politics of the time. But about 1888 Filipinos began to be admitted
into some of them, and later, chiefly through the exertions of Pilar,
lodges exclusively for them were instituted. These soon began to
display great activity, especially in the transcendental matter of
collections, so that their existence became a source of care to the
government and a nightmare to the religious orders. From them, and with
a perversion of the idea in Rizal&rsquo;s still-born <i lang=
"es">Liga</i>, it was an easy transition to the Katipunan, which was to
put aside all pretense of reconciliation with Spain, and at the
appointed time rise to exterminate not only the friars but also all the
Spaniards and Spanish sympathizers, thus to bring about the reign of
Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, under the benign guidance of Patriot
Bonifacio, with his bolo for a scepter.</p>
<p class="par">With its secrecy and mystic forms, its methods of
threats and intimidation, the Katipunan spread rapidly, especially
among the Tagalogs, the most intransigent of the native peoples, and,
it should be noted, the ones in Whose territory the friars were the
principal landlords. It was organized on the triangle plan, so that no
member might know or communicate with more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e632" href="#xd24e632" name=
"xd24e632">xl</a>]</span>than three others&mdash;the one above him from
whom he received his information and instructions and two below to whom
he transmitted them. The initiations were conducted with great secrecy
and solemnity, calculated to inspire the new members with awe and fear.
The initiate, after a series of blood-curdling ordeals to try out his
courage and resolution, swore on a human skull a terrific oath to
devote his life and energies to the extermination of the white race,
regardless of age or sex, and later affixed to it his signature or
mark, usually the latter, with his own blood taken from an incision in
the left arm or left breast. This was one form of the famous
&ldquo;blood compact,&rdquo; which, if history reads aright, played so
important a part in the assumption of sovereignty over the Philippines
by Legazpi in the name of Philip II.</p>
<p class="par">Rizal was made the honorary president of the
association, his portrait hung in all the meeting-halls, and the magic
of his name used to attract the easily deluded masses, who were in a
state of agitated ignorance and growing unrest, ripe for any movement
that looked anti-governmental, and especially anti-Spanish. Soon after
the organization had been perfected, collections began to be taken
up&mdash;those collections were never overlooked&mdash;for the purpose
of chartering a steamer to rescue him from Dapitan and transport him to
Singapore, whence he might direct the general uprising, the day and the
hour for which were fixed by Bonifacio for August twenty-sixth, 1896,
at six o&rsquo;clock sharp in the evening, since lack of precision in
his magnificent programs was never a fault of that bold patriot, his
logic being as severe as that of the Filipino policeman who put the
flag at half-mast on Good Friday.</p>
<p class="par">Of all this Rizal himself was, of course, entirely
ignorant, until in May, 1896, a Filipino doctor named Pio Valenzuela, a
creature of Bonifacio&rsquo;s, was despatched to Dapitan, taking along
a blind man as a pretext for the visit to the famous oculist, to lay
the plans before him for his consent and approval. Rizal expostulated
with Valenzuela for a time over such a mad and hopeless venture, which
would only bring ruin and misery upon the masses, and then is said to
have very humanly lost his patience, ending the interview &ldquo;in so
bad a humor and with words so offensive that the deponent, who had gone
with the intention of remaining there a month, took the steamer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e638" href="#xd24e638" name=
"xd24e638">xli</a>]</span>on the following day, for return to
Manila.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e640src" href="#xd24e640"
name="xd24e640src">12</a> He reported secretly to Bonifacio, who
bestowed several choice Tagalog epithets on Rizal, and charged his
envoy to say nothing about the failure of his mission, but rather to
give the impression that he had been successful. Rizal&rsquo;s name
continued to be used as the shibboleth of the insurrection, and the
masses were made to believe that he would appear as their leader at the
appointed hour.</p>
<p class="par">Vague reports from police officers, to the effect that
something unusual in the nature of secret societies was going on among
the people, began to reach the government, but no great attention was
paid to them, until the evening of August nineteenth, when the parish
priest of Tondo was informed by the mother-superior of one of the
convent-schools that she had just learned of a plot to massacre all the
Spaniards. She had the information from a devoted pupil, whose brother
was a compositor in the office of the <i lang="es">Diario de
Manila</i>. As is so frequently the case in Filipino families, this
elder sister was the purse-holder, and the brother&rsquo;s insistent
requests for money, which was needed by him to meet the repeated
assessments made on the members as the critical hour approached,
awakened her curiosity and suspicion to such an extent that she forced
him to confide the whole plan to her. Without delay she divulged it to
her patroness, who in turn notified the curate of Tondo, where the
printing-office was located. The priest called in two officers of the
Civil Guard, who arrested the young printer, frightened a confession
out of him, and that night, in company with the friar, searched the
printing-office, finding secreted there several lithographic plates for
printing receipts and certificates of membership in the Katipunan, with
a number of documents giving some account of the plot.</p>
<p class="par">Then the Spanish population went wild. General Ramon
Blanco was governor and seems to have been about the only person who
kept his head at all. He tried to prevent giving so irresponsible a
movement a fictitious importance, but was utterly powerless to stay the
clamor for blood which at once arose, loudest on the part of those
alleged ministers of the gentle Christ. The gates of the old Walled
City, long fallen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e650" href=
"#xd24e650" name="xd24e650">xlii</a>]</span>into disuse, were cleaned
and put in order, martial law was declared, and wholesale arrests made.
Many of the prisoners were confined in Fort Santiago, one batch being
crowded into a dungeon for which the only ventilation was a grated
opening at the top, and one night a sergeant of the guard carelessly
spread his sleeping-mat over this, so the next morning some fifty-five
asphyxiated corpses were hauled away. On the twenty-sixth armed
insurrection broke out at Caloocan, just north of Manila, from time
immemorial the resort of bad characters from all the country round and
the center of brigandage, while at San Juan del Monte, on the outskirts
of the city, several bloody skirmishes were fought a few days later
with the <i lang="es">Guardia Civil Veterana</i>, the picked police
force.</p>
<p class="par">Bonifacio had been warned of the discovery of his
schemes in time to make his escape and flee to the barrio, or village,
of Balintawak, a few miles north of Manila, thence to lead the attack
on Caloocan and inaugurate the reign of Liberty, Equality, and
Fraternity in the manner in which Philippine insurrections have
generally had a habit of starting&mdash;with the murder of Chinese
merchants and the pillage of their shops. He had from the first
reserved for himself the important office of treasurer in the
Katipunan, in addition to being on occasions president and at all times
its ruling spirit, so he now established himself as dictator and
proceeded to appoint a magnificent staff, most of whom contrived to
escape as soon as they were out of reach of his bolo. Yet he drew
considerable numbers about him, for this man, though almost entirely
unlettered, seems to have been quite a personality among his own
people, especially possessed of that gift of oratory in his native
tongue to which the Malay is so preeminently susceptible.</p>
<p class="par">In Manila a special tribunal was constituted and worked
steadily, sometimes through the siesta-hour, for there were times, of
which this was one, when even Spanish justice could be swift.
Bagumbayan began to be a veritable field of blood, as the old methods
of repression were resorted to for the purpose of striking terror into
the native population by wholesale executions, nor did the ruling
powers realize that the time for such methods had passed. It was a case
of sixteenth-century colonial methods fallen into fretful and frantic
senility, so in all this wretched business it is doubtful whim to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e659" href="#xd24e659" name=
"xd24e659">xliii</a>]</span>pity the more: the blind stupidity of the
fossilized conservatives incontinently throwing an empire away,
forfeiting their influence over a people whom they, by temperament and
experience, should have been fitted to control and govern; or the
potential cruelty of perverted human nature in the dark Frankenstein
who would wreak upon the rulers in their decadent days the most hideous
of the methods in the system that produced him, as he planned his
festive holocaust and carmagnole on the spot where every spark of
initiative and leadership among his people, both good and bad, had been
summarily and ruthlessly extinguished. There is at least a world of
reflection in it for the rulers of men.</p>
<p class="par">In the meantime Rizal, wearying of the quiet life in
Dapitan and doubtless foreseeing the impending catastrophe, had
requested leave to volunteer his services as a physician in the
military hospitals of Cuba, of the horrors and sufferings in which he
had heard. General Blanco at once gladly acceded to this request and
had him brought to Manila, but unfortunately the boat carrying him
arrived there a day too late for him to catch the regular August
mail-steamer to Spain, so he was kept in the cruiser a prisoner of war,
awaiting the next transportation. While he was thus detained, the
Katipunan plot was discovered and the rebellion broke out. He was
accused of being the head of it, but Blanco gave him a personal letter
completely exonerating him from any complicity in the outbreak, as well
as a letter of recommendation to the Spanish minister of war. He was
placed on the <i lang="es">Isla de Panay</i> when it left for Spain on
September third and traveled at first as a passenger. At Singapore he
was advised to land and claim British protection, as did some of his
fellow travelers, but he refused to do so, saying that his conscience
was clear.</p>
<p class="par">As the name of Rizal had constantly recurred during the
trials of the Katipunan suspects, the military tribunal finally issued
a formal demand for him. The order of arrest was cabled to Port Said
and Rizal there placed in solitary confinement for the remainder of the
voyage. Arrived at Barcelona, he was confined in the grim fortress of
Montjuich, where; by a curious coincidence, the governor was the same
Despujols who had issued the decree of banishment in 1892. Shortly
afterwards, he was placed on the transport <i>Colon</i>, which was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e672" href="#xd24e672" name=
"xd24e672">xliv</a>]</span>bound for the Philippines with troops,
Blanco having at last been stirred to action. Strenuous efforts were
now made by Rizal&rsquo;s friends in London to have him removed from
the ship at Singapore, but the British authorities declined to take any
action, on the ground that he was on a Spanish warship and therefore
beyond the jurisdiction of their courts. The <i>Colon</i> arrived at
Manila on November third and Rizal was imprisoned in Fort Santiago,
while a special tribunal was constituted to try him on the charges of
carrying on anti-patriotic and anti-religious propaganda, rebellion,
sedition, and the formation of illegal associations. Some other charges
may have been overlooked in the hurry and excitement.</p>
<p class="par">It would be almost a travesty to call a trial the
proceedings which began early in December and dragged along until the
twenty-sixth. Rizal was defended by a young Spanish officer selected by
him from among a number designated by the tribunal, who chivalrously
performed so unpopular a duty as well as he could. But the whole affair
was a mockery of justice, for the Spanish government in the Philippines
had finally and hopelessly reached the condition graphically pictured
by Mr. Kipling:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Panic that shells the drifting spar&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Loud waste with none to check&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Mad fear that rakes a scornful star</p>
<p class="line">Or sweeps a consort&rsquo;s deck!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The clamor against Blanco had resulted in his
summary removal by royal decree and the appointment of a real
&ldquo;pacificator,&rdquo; Camilo Polavieja.</p>
<p class="par">While in prison Rizal prepared an address to those of
his countrymen who were in armed rebellion, repudiating the use of his
name and deprecating the resort to violence. The closing words are a
compendium of his life and beliefs: &ldquo;Countrymen: I have given
proofs, as well as the best of you, of desiring liberty for our
country, and I continue to desire it. But I place as a premise the
education of the people, so that by means of instruction and work they
may have a personality of their own and that they may make themselves
worthy of that same liberty. In my writings I have recommended the
study of the civic virtues, without which there can be no redemption. I
have also written (and my words have been repeated) that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e692" href="#xd24e692" name=

condemn, and I do condemn, this absurd, savage rebellion, planned
behind my back, which dishonors the Filipinos and discredits those who
can speak for us. I abominate all criminal actions and refuse any kind
of participation in them, pitying with all my heart the dupes who have

however, was not published by the Spanish authorities, since they did
not consider it &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; enough; instead, they killed
the writer!</p>
<p class="par">Rizal appeared before the tribunal bound, closely
guarded by two Peninsular soldiers, but maintained his serenity
throughout and answered the charges in a straightforward way. He
pointed out the fact that he had never taken any great part in
politics, having even quarreled with Marcelo del Pilar, the active
leader of the anti-clericals, by reason of those perennial
&ldquo;subscriptions,&rdquo; and that during the time he was accused of
being the instigator and organizer of armed rebellion he had been a
close prisoner in Dapitan under strict surveillance by both the
military and ecclesiastical authorities. The prosecutor presented a
lengthy document, which ran mostly to words, about the only definite
conclusion laid down in it being that the Philippines &ldquo;are, and
always must remain, Spanish territory.&rdquo; What there may have been
in Rizal&rsquo;s career to hang such a conclusion upon is not quite
dear, but at any rate this learned legal light was evidently still
thinking in colors on the map serenely unconscious in his European
pseudo-prescience of the new and wonderful development in the Western
Hemisphere&mdash;humanity militant, Lincolnism.</p>
<p class="par">The death sentence was asked, but the longer the case
dragged on the more favorable it began to look for the accused, so the
president of the tribunal, after deciding, Jeffreys-like, that the
charges had been proved, ordered that no further evidence be taken.
Rizal betrayed some sunrise when his doom was thus foreshadowed, for,
dreamer that he was, he seems not to have anticipated such a fatal
eventuality for himself. He did not lose his serenity, however, even
when the tribunal promptly brought in a verdict of guilty and imposed
the death sentence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e704" href=
"#xd24e704" name="xd24e704">xlvi</a>]</span>upon which Polavieja the
next day placed his <i>C&uacute;mplase</i>, fixing the morning of
December thirtieth for the execution.</p>
<p class="par">So Rizal&rsquo;s fate was sealed. The witnesses against
him, in so far as there was any substantial testimony at all, had been
his own countrymen, coerced or cajoled into making statements which
they have since repudiated as false, and which in some cases were
extorted from them by threats and even torture. But he betrayed very
little emotion, even maintaining what must have been an assumed
cheerfulness. Only one reproach is recorded: that he had been made a
dupe of, that he had been deceived by every one, even the
<i>bankeros</i> and <i>cocheros</i>. His old Jesuit instructors
remained with him in the <i>capilla</i>, or death-cell,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e720src" href="#xd24e720" name="xd24e720src">13</a>
and largely through the influence of an image of the Sacred Heart,
which he had carved as a schoolboy, it is claimed that a reconciliation
with the Church was effected. There has been considerable pragmatical
discussion as to what form of retraction from him was necessary, since
he had been, after studying in Europe, a frank freethinker, but such
futile polemics may safely be left to the learned doctors. That he was
reconciled with the Church would seem to be evidenced by the fact that
just before the execution he gave legal status as his wife to the
woman, a rather remarkable Eurasian adventuress, who had lived with him
in Dapitan, and the religious ceremony was the only one then recognized
in the islands.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e728src" href="#xd24e728"
name="xd24e728src">14</a> The greater part of his last night on earth
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e734" href="#xd24e734" name=
"xd24e734">xlvii</a>]</span>spent in composing a chain of verse; no
very majestic flight of poesy, but a pathetic monody throbbing with
patient resignation and inextinguishable hope, one of the sweetest,
saddest swan-songs ever sung.</p>
<p class="par">Thus he was left at the last, entirely alone. As soon as
his doom became certain the Patriots had all scurried to cover, one
gentle poetaster even rushing into doggerel verse to condemn him as a
reversion to barbarism; the wealthier suspects betook themselves to
other lands or made judicious use of their money-bags among the Spanish
officials; the better classes of the population floundered hopelessly,
leaderless, in the confused whirl of opinions and passions; while the
voiceless millions for whom he had spoken moved on in dumb,
uncomprehending silence. He had lived in that higher dreamland of the
future, ahead of his countrymen, ahead even of those who assumed to be
the mentors of his people, and he must learn, as does every noble soul
that labors &ldquo;to make the bounds of freedom wider yet,&rdquo; the
bitter lesson that nine-tenths, if not all, the woes that afflict
humanity spring from man&rsquo;s own stupid selfishness, that the
wresting of the scepter from the tyrant is often the least of the task,
that the bondman comes to love his bonds&mdash;like Chillon&rsquo;s
prisoner, his very chains and he grow friends,&mdash;but that the
struggle for human freedom must go on, at whatever cost, in
ever-widening circles, &ldquo;wave after wave, each mightier than the
last,&rdquo; for as long as one body toils in fetters or one mind
welters in blind ignorance, either of the slave&rsquo;s base delusion
or the despot&rsquo;s specious illusion, there can be no final security
for any free man, or his children, or his children&rsquo;s children.

</div>
<p class="par first xd24e163">COLERIDGE.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was one of those magic December mornings of the
tropics&mdash;the very nuptials of earth and sky, when great Nature
seems to fling herself incontinently into creation, wrapping the world
in a brooding calm of light and color, that Spain chose for committing
political suicide in the Philippines. Bagumbayan Field was crowded with
troops, both regulars and militia, for every man capable of being
trusted with arms was drawn up there, excepting only the necessary
guards in other parts of the city. Extra patrols were in the streets,
double guards were placed over the archiepiscopal and gubernatorial
palaces. The calmest man in all Manila that day was he who must stand
before the firing-squad.</p>
<p class="par">Two special and unusual features are to be noted about
this execution. All the principal actors were Filipinos: the commander
of the troops and the officer directly in charge of the execution were
native-born, while the firing-squad itself was drawn from a local
native regiment, though it is true that on this occasion a squad of
Peninsular <i>cazadores</i>, armed with loaded Mausers, stood directly
behind them to see that they failed not in their duty. Again, there was
but one victim; for it seems to have ever been the custom of the
Spanish rulers to associate in these gruesome affairs some real
criminals with the political offenders, no doubt with the intentional
purpose of confusing the issue in the general mind. Rizal standing
alone, the occasion of so much hurried preparation and fearful
precaution, is a pathetic testimonial to the degree of incapacity into
which the ruling powers had fallen, even in chicanery.</p>
<p class="par">After bidding good-by to his sister and making final
disposition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e763" href="#xd24e763"
name="xd24e763">xlix</a>]</span>regarding some personal property, the
doomed man, under close guard, walked calmly, even cheerfully, from
Fort Santiago along the Malecon to the Luneta, accompanied by his
Jesuit confessors. Arrived there, he thanked those about him for their
kindness and requested the officer in charge to allow him to face the
firing-squad, since he had never been a traitor to Spain. This the
officer declined to permit, for the order was to shoot him in the back.
Rizal assented with a slight protest, pointed out to the soldiers the
spot in his back at which they should aim, and with a firm step took
his place in front of them.</p>
<p class="par">Then occurred an act almost too hideous to record. There
he stood, expecting a volley of Remington bullets in his
back&mdash;Time was, and Life&rsquo;s stream ebbed to Eternity&rsquo;s
flood&mdash;when the military surgeon stepped forward and asked if he
might feel his pulse! Rizal extended his left hand, and the officer
remarked that he could not understand how a man&rsquo;s pulse could
beat normally at such a terrific moment! The victim shrugged his
shoulders and let the hand fall again to his side&mdash;Latin
refinement could be no further refined!</p>
<p class="par">A moment later there he lay, on his right side, his
life-blood spurting over the Luneta curb, eyes wide open, fixedly
staring at that Heaven where the priests had taught all those centuries
agone that Justice abides. The troops filed past the body, for the most
part silently, while desultory cries of &ldquo;<i lang="es">Viva
Espa&ntilde;a!</i>&rdquo; from among the &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo;
Filipino volunteers were summarily hushed by a Spanish
artillery-officer&rsquo;s stern rebuke: &ldquo;Silence, you
rabble!&rdquo; To drown out the fitful cheers and the audible murmurs,
the bands struck up Spanish national airs. Stranger death-dirge no man
and system ever had. Carnival revelers now dance about the scene and
Filipino schoolboys play baseball over that same spot.</p>
<p class="par">A few days later another execution was held on that
spot, of members of the <i>Liga</i>, some of them characters that would
have richly deserved shooting at any place or time, according to
existing standards, but notable among them there knelt, torture-crazed,
as to his orisons, Francisco Roxas, millionaire capitalist, who may be
regarded as the social and economic head of the Filipino people, as
Rizal was fitted to be their intellectual leader. Shades of Anda and
Vargas! Out there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e777" href=
"#xd24e777" name="xd24e777">l</a>]</span>at Balintawak&mdash;rather
fitly, &ldquo;the home of the snake-demon,&rdquo;&mdash;not three
hours&rsquo; march from this same spot, on the very edge of the city,
Andres Bonifacio and his literally sansculottic gangs of cutthroats
were, almost with impunity, soiling the fair name of Freedom with
murder and mutilation, rape and rapine, awakening the worst passions of
an excitable, impulsive people, destroying that essential respect for
law and order, which to restore would take a holocaust of fire and
blood, with a generation of severe training. Unquestionably did Rizal
demonstrate himself to be a seer and prophet when he applied to such a
system the story of Babylon and the fateful handwriting on the
wall!</p>
<p class="par">But forces had been loosed that would not be so
suppressed, the time had gone by when such wild methods of repression
would serve. The destruction of the native leaders, culminating in the
executions of Rizal and Roxas, produced a counter-effect by rousing the
Tagalogs, good and bad alike, to desperate fury, and the aftermath was
frightful. The better classes were driven to take part in the
rebellion, and Cavite especially became a veritable slaughter-pen, as
the contest settled down into a hideous struggle for mutual
extermination. Dark Andres went his wild way to perish by the violence
he had himself invoked, a prey to the rising ambition of a young leader
of considerable culture and ability, a schoolmaster named Emilio
Aguinaldo. His Katipunan hovered fitfully around Manila, for a time
even drawing to itself in their desperation some of the better elements
of the population, only to find itself sold out and deserted by its
leaders, dying away for a time; but later, under changed conditions, it
reappeared in strange metamorphosis as the rallying-center for the
largest number of Filipinos who have ever gathered together for a
common purpose, and then finally went down before those thin grim lines
in khaki with sharp and sharpest shot clearing away the wreck of the
old, blazing the way for the new: the broadening sweep of
&ldquo;Democracy announcing, in rifle-volleys death-winged, under her
Star Banner, to the tune of Yankee-doodle-do, that she is born, and,
whirlwind-like, will envelop the whole world!&rdquo;</p>

Retana&rsquo;s deserves quotation as an estimate of the living man by a
Spanish publicist who was at the time in the employ of the friars and
contemptuously hostile to Rizal, but who has since 1898 been giving
quite a spectacular demonstration of waving a red light after the
wreck, having become his most enthusiastic, almost hysterical,
biographer: &ldquo;Rizal is what is commonly called a character, but he
has repeatedly demonstrated very great inexperience in the affairs of
life. I believe him to be now about thirty-two years old. He is the
Indian of most ability among those who have

<i>Capilla</i>: the Spanish practise is to place a condemned person for
the twenty-four hours preceding his execution in a <i>chapel</i>, or a
cell fitted up as such, where he may devote himself to religious

<p class="par footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e728" href="#xd24e728src" name="xd24e728">14</a></span> But even
this conclusion is open to doubt: there is no proof beyond the
unsupported statement of the Jesuits that he made a written retraction,
which was later destroyed, though why a document so interesting, and so
important in support of their own point of view, should not have been
preserved furnishes an illuminating commentary on the whole confused
affair. The only unofficial witness present was the condemned
man&rsquo;s sister, and her declaration, that she was at the time in
such a state of excitement and distress that she is unable to affirm
positively that there was a real marriage ceremony performed, can
readily be accepted. It must be remembered that the Jesuits were
themselves under the official and popular ban for the part they had
played in Rizal&rsquo;s education and development and that they were
seeking to set themselves right in order to maintain their prestige.
Add to this the persistent and systematic effort made to destroy every

<p class="par first">To My Fatherland:</p>
<p class="par">Recorded in the history of human sufferings is a cancer
of so malignant a character that the least touch irritates it and
awakens in it the sharpest pains. Thus, how many times, when in the
midst of modern civilizations I have wished to call thee before me, now
to accompany me in memories, now to compare thee with other countries,
hath thy dear image presented itself showing a social cancer like to
that other!</p>
<p class="par">Desiring thy welfare, which is our own, and seeking the
best treatment, I will do with thee what the ancients did with their
sick, exposing them on the steps of the temple so that every one who
came to invoke the Divinity might offer them a remedy.</p>
<p class="par">And to this end, I will strive to reproduce thy
condition faithfully, without discriminations; I will raise a part of
the veil that covers the evil, sacrificing to truth everything, even
vanity itself, since, as thy son, I am conscious that I also suffer
from thy defects and weaknesses.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the last of October Don Santiago de los Santos,
popularly known as Capitan Tiago, gave a dinner. In spite of the fact
that, contrary to his usual custom, he had made the announcement only
that afternoon, it was already the sole topic of conversation in
Binondo and adjacent districts, and even in the Walled City, for at
that time Capitan Tiago was considered one of the most hospitable of
men, and it was well known that his house, like his country, shut its
doors against nothing except commerce and all new or bold ideas. Like
an electric shock the announcement ran through the world of parasites,
bores, and hangers-on, whom God in His infinite bounty creates and so
kindly multiplies in Manila. Some looked at once for shoe-polish,
others for buttons and cravats, but all were especially concerned about
how to greet the master of the house in the most familiar tone, in
order to create an atmosphere of ancient friendship or, if occasion
should arise, to excuse a late arrival.</p>
<p class="par">This dinner was given in a house on Calle Anloague, and
although we do not remember the number we will describe it in such a
way that it may still be recognized, provided the earthquakes have not
destroyed it. We do not believe that its owner has had it torn down,
for such labors are generally entrusted to God or nature&mdash;which
Powers hold the contracts also for many of the projects of our
government. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1251" href=
"#xd24e1251" name="xd24e1251">2</a>]</span>is a rather large building,
in the style of many in the country, and fronts upon the arm of the
Pasig which is known to some as the Binondo River, and which, like all
the streams in Manila, plays the varied r&ocirc;les of bath, sewer,
laundry, fishery, means of transportation and communication, and even
drinking water if the Chinese water-carrier finds it convenient. It is
worthy of note that in the distance of nearly a mile this important
artery of the district, where traffic is most dense and movement most
deafening, can boast of only one wooden bridge, which is out of repair
on one side for six months and impassable on the other for the rest of
the year, so that during the hot season the ponies take advantage of
this permanent <i>status quo</i> to jump off the bridge into the water,
to the great surprise of the abstracted mortal who may be dozing inside
the carriage or philosophizing upon the progress of the age.</p>
<p class="par">The house of which we are speaking is somewhat low and
not exactly correct in all its lines: whether the architect who built
it was afflicted with poor eyesight or whether the earthquakes and
typhoons have twisted it out of shape, no one can say with certainty. A
wide staircase with green newels and carpeted steps leads from the
tiled entrance up to the main floor between rows of flower-pots set
upon pedestals of motley-colored and fantastically decorated Chinese
porcelain. Since there are neither porters nor servants who demand
invitation cards, we will go in, O you who read this, whether friend or
foe, if you are attracted by the strains of the orchestra, the lights,
or the suggestive rattling of dishes, knives, and forks, and if you
wish to see what such a gathering is like in the distant Pearl of the
Orient. Gladly, and for my own comfort, I should spare you this
description of the house, were it not of great importance, since we
mortals in general are very much like tortoises: we are esteemed and
classified according to our shells; in this and still other respects
the mortals of the Philippines in particular also resemble
tortoises.</p>
<p class="par">If we go up the stairs, we immediately find ourselves in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1260" href="#xd24e1260" name=
"xd24e1260">3</a>]</span>a spacious hallway, called there, for some
unknown reason, the <i>caida</i>, which tonight serves as the
dining-room and at the same time affords a place for the orchestra. In
the center a large table profusely and expensively decorated seems to
beckon to the hanger-on with sweet promises, while it threatens the
bashful maiden, the simple <i>dalaga</i>, with two mortal hours in the
company of strangers whose language and conversation usually have a
very restricted and special character.</p>
<p class="par">Contrasted with these terrestrial preparations are the
motley paintings on the walls representing religious matters, such as
&ldquo;Purgatory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last
Judgment,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of the Just,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Death of the Sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At the back of the room, fastened in a splendid and
elegant framework, in the Renaissance style, possibly by
Ar&eacute;valo, is a glass case in which are seen the figures of two
old women. The inscription on this reads: &ldquo;Our Lady of Peace and
Prosperous Voyages, who is worshiped in Antipolo, visiting in the
disguise of a beggar the holy and renowned Capitana Inez during her
sickness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1272src" href="#xd24e1272"
name="xd24e1272src">1</a> While the work reveals little taste or art,
yet it possesses in compensation an extreme realism, for to judge from
the yellow and bluish tints of her face the sick woman seems to be
already a decaying corpse, and the glasses and other objects,
accompaniments of long illness, are so minutely reproduced that even
their contents may be distinguished. In looking at these pictures,
which excite the appetite and inspire gay bucolic ideas, one may
perhaps be led to think that the malicious host is well acquainted with
the characters of the majority of those who are to sit at his table and
that, in order to conceal his own way of thinking, he has hung from the
ceiling costly Chinese lanterns; bird-cages without birds; red, green,
and blue globes of frosted glass; faded air-plants; and dried and
inflated fishes, which they call <i>botetes</i>. The view is closed on
the side of the river by curious wooden arches, half Chinese and half
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1281" href="#xd24e1281" name=
"xd24e1281">4</a>]</span>European, affording glimpses of a terrace with
arbors and bowers faintly lighted by paper lanterns of many colors.</p>
<p class="par">In the sala, among massive mirrors and gleaming
chandeliers, the guests are assembled. Here, on a raised platform,
stands a grand piano of great price, which tonight has the additional
virtue of not being played upon. Here, hanging on the wall, is an
oil-painting of a handsome man in full dress, rigid, erect, straight as
the tasseled cane he holds in his stiff, ring-covered fingers&mdash;the
whole seeming to say, &ldquo;Ahem! See how well dressed and how
dignified I am!&rdquo; The furnishings of the room are elegant and
perhaps uncomfortable and unhealthful, since the master of the house
would consider not so much the comfort and health of his guests as his
own ostentation, &ldquo;A terrible thing is dysentery,&rdquo; he would
say to them, &ldquo;but you are sitting in European chairs and that is
something you don&rsquo;t find every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This room is almost filled with people, the men being
separated from the women as in synagogues and Catholic churches. The
women consist of a number of Filipino and Spanish maidens, who, when
they open their mouths to yawn, instantly cover them with their fans
and who murmur only a few words to each other, any conversation
ventured upon dying out in monosyllables like the sounds heard in a
house at night, sounds made by the rats and lizards. Is it perhaps the
different likenesses of Our Lady hanging on the walls that force them
to silence and a religious demeanor or is it that the women here are an
exception?</p>
<p class="par">A cousin of Capitan Tiago, a sweet-faced old woman, who
speaks Spanish quite badly, is the only one receiving the ladies. To
offer to the Spanish ladies a plate of cigars and <i>buyos</i>, to
extend her hand to her countrywomen to be kissed, exactly as the friars
do,&mdash;this is the sum of her courtesy, her policy. The poor old
lady soon became bored, and taking advantage of the noise of a plate
breaking, rushed precipitately away, muttering,
&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> Just wait, you rascals!&rdquo; and failed
to reappear.</p>
<p class="par">The men, for their part, are making more of a stir. Some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1298" href="#xd24e1298" name=
"xd24e1298">5</a>]</span>cadets in one corner are conversing in a
lively manner but in low tones, looking around now and then to point
out different persons in the room while they laugh more or less openly
among themselves. In contrast, two foreigners dressed in white are
promenading silently from one end of the room to the other with their
hands crossed behind their backs, like the bored passengers on the deck
of a ship. All the interest and the greatest animation proceed from a
group composed of two priests, two civilians, and a soldier who are
seated around a small table on which are seen bottles of wine and
English biscuits.</p>
<p class="par">The soldier, a tall, elderly lieutenant with an austere
countenance&mdash;a Duke of Alva straggling behind in the roster of the
Civil Guard&mdash;talks little, but in a harsh, curt way. One of the
priests, a youthful Dominican friar, handsome, graceful, polished as
the gold-mounted eyeglasses he wears, maintains a premature gravity. He
is the curate of Binondo and has been in former years a professor in
the college of San Juan de Letran,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1302src"
href="#xd24e1302" name="xd24e1302src">2</a> where he enjoyed the
reputation of being a consummate dialectician, so much so that in the
days when the sons of Guzman<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1308src" href=
"#xd24e1308" name="xd24e1308src">3</a> still dared to match themselves
in subtleties with laymen, the able disputant B. de Luna had never been
able either to catch or to confuse him, the distinctions made by Fray
Sibyla leaving his opponent in the situation of a fisherman who tries
to catch eels with a lasso. The Dominican says little, appearing to
weigh his words.</p>
<p class="par">Quite in contrast, the other priest, a Franciscan, talks
much and gesticulates more. In spite of the fact that his hair is
beginning to turn gray, he seems to be preserving <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1313" href="#xd24e1313" name=
"xd24e1313">6</a>]</span>well his robust constitution, while his
regular features, his rather disquieting glance, his wide jaws and
herculean frame give him the appearance of a Roman noble in disguise
and make us involuntarily recall one of those three monks of whom Heine
tells in his &ldquo;Gods in Exile,&rdquo; who at the September equinox
in the Tyrol used to cross a lake at midnight and each time place in
the hand of the poor boatman a silver piece, cold as ice, which left
him full of terror.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1315src" href=
"#xd24e1315" name="xd24e1315src">4</a> But Fray Damaso is not so
mysterious as they were. He is full of merriment, and if the tone of
his voice is rough like that of a man who has never had occasion to
correct himself and who believes that whatever he says is holy and
above improvement, still his frank, merry laugh wipes out this
disagreeable impression and even obliges us to pardon his showing to
the room bare feet and hairy legs that would make the fortune of a
Mendieta in the Quiapo fairs.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1318src" href=
"#xd24e1318" name="xd24e1318src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">One of the civilians is a very small man with a black
beard, the only thing notable about him being his nose, which, to judge
from its size, ought not to belong to him. The other is a rubicund
youth, who seems to have arrived but recently in the country. With him
the Franciscan is carrying on a lively discussion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; the friar was saying,
&ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve been here a few months you&rsquo;ll be
convinced of what I say. It&rsquo;s one thing to govern in Madrid and
another to live in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I, for example,&rdquo; continued Fray Damaso,
raising his voice still higher to prevent the other from speaking,
&ldquo;I, for example, who can look back over twenty-three years of
bananas and <i>morisqueta</i>, know whereof I speak. Don&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1332" href="#xd24e1332" name=
"xd24e1332">7</a>]</span>come at me with theories and fine speeches,
for I know the Indian.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1334src" href=
"#xd24e1334" name="xd24e1334src">6</a> Mark well that the moment I
arrived in the country I was assigned to a toxin, small it is true, but
especially devoted to agriculture. I didn&rsquo;t understand Tagalog
very well then, but I was, soon confessing the women, and we understood
one another and they came to like me so well that three years later,
when I was transferred to another and larger town, made vacant by the
death of the native curate, all fell to weeping, they heaped gifts upon
me, they escorted me with music&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But that only goes to show&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait, wait! Don&rsquo;t be so hasty! My successor
remained a shorter time, and when he left he had more attendance, more
tears, and more music. Yet he had been more given to whipping and had
raised the fees in the parish to almost double.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you will allow me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t all. I stayed in the town of
San Diego twenty years and it has been only a few months since I left
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here he showed signs of chagrin.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Twenty years, no one can deny, are more than
sufficient to get acquainted with a town. San Diego has a population of
six thousand souls and I knew every inhabitant as well as if I had been
his mother and wet-nurse. I knew in which foot this one was lame, where
the shoe pinched that one, who was courting that girl, what affairs she
had had and with whom, who was the real father of the child, and so
on&mdash;for I was the confessor of every last one, and they took care
not to fail in their duty. Our host, Santiago, will tell you whether I
am speaking the truth, for he has a lot of land there and that was
where we first became friends. Well then, you may see what the Indian
is: when I left I was escorted by only a few old women and some of the
tertiary brethren&mdash;and that after I had been there twenty
years!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see what that has to do with
the abolition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1352" href=
"#xd24e1352" name="xd24e1352">8</a>]</span>of the tobacco
monopoly,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1354src" href="#xd24e1354"
name="xd24e1354src">7</a> ventured the rubicund youth, taking advantage
of the Franciscan&rsquo;s pausing to drink a glass of sherry.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Damaso was so greatly surprised that he nearly let
his glass fall. He remained for a moment staring fixedly at the young
man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What? How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he was finally
able to exclaim in great wonderment. &ldquo;Is it possible that you
don&rsquo;t see it as clear as day? Don&rsquo;t you see, my son, that
all this proves plainly that the reforms of the ministers are
irrational?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was now the youth&rsquo;s turn to look perplexed. The
lieutenant wrinkled his eyebrows a little more and the small man nodded
toward Fray Damaso equivocally. The Dominican contented himself with
almost turning his back on the whole group.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you really believe so?&rdquo; the young man at
length asked with great seriousness, as he looked at the friar with
curiosity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do I believe so? As I believe the Gospel! The
Indian is so indolent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, pardon me for interrupting you,&rdquo; said
the young man, lowering his voice and drawing his chair a little
closer, &ldquo;but you have said something that awakens all my
interest. Does this indolence actually, naturally, exist among the
natives or is there some truth in what a foreign traveler says: that
with this indolence we excuse our own, as well as our backwardness and
our colonial system. He referred to other colonies whose inhabitants
belong to the same race&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1373" href=
"#xd24e1373" name="xd24e1373">9</a>]</span>&ldquo;Bah, jealousy! Ask
Se&ntilde;or Laruja, who also knows this country. Ask him if there is
any equal to the ignorance and indolence of the Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; affirmed the little man,
who was referred to as Se&ntilde;or Laruja. &ldquo;In no part of the
world can you find any one more indolent than the Indian, in no part of
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor more vicious, nor more ungrateful!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor more unmannerly!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The rubicund youth began to glance about nervously.
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I believe that we are in
the house of an Indian. Those young ladies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah, don&rsquo;t be so apprehensive! Santiago
doesn&rsquo;t consider himself an Indian&mdash;and besides, he&rsquo;s
not here. And what if he were! These are the nonsensical ideas of the
newcomers. Let a few months pass and you will change your opinion,
after you have attended a lot of fiestas and <i>bail&uacute;han</i>,
slept on cots, and eaten your fill of <i>tinola</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, is this thing that you call <i>tinola</i> a
variety of lotus which makes
people&mdash;er&mdash;forgetful?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing of the kind!&rdquo; exclaimed Fray Damaso
with a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting absurd. <i>Tinola</i> is a
stew of chicken and squash. How long has it been since you got
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Four days,&rdquo; responded the youth, rather
offended.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you come as a government
employee?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;ve come at my own expense to
study the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Man, what a rare bird!&rdquo; exclaimed Fray
Damaso, staring at him with curiosity. &ldquo;To come at one&rsquo;s
own expense and for such foolishness! What a wonder! When there are so
many books! And with two fingerbreadths of forehead! Many have written
books as big as that! With two fingerbreadths of forehead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Dominican here brusquely broke in upon the
conversation. &ldquo;Did your Reverence, Fray Damaso, say that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1413" href="#xd24e1413" name=
"xd24e1413">10</a>]</span>you had been twenty years in the town of San
Diego and that you had left it? Wasn&rsquo;t your Reverence satisfied
with the town?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At this question, which was put in a very natural and
almost negligent tone, Fray Damaso suddenly lost all his merriment and
stopped laughing. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he grunted dryly, and let himself
back heavily against the back of his chair.</p>
<p class="par">The Dominican went on in a still more indifferent tone.
&ldquo;It must be painful to leave a town where one has been for twenty
years and which he knows as well as the clothes he wears. I certainly
was sorry to leave Kamiling and that after I had been there only a few
months. But my superiors did it for the good of the Orders for my own
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Damaso, for the first time that evening, seemed to
be very thoughtful. Suddenly he brought his fist down on the arm of his
chair and with a heavy breath exclaimed: &ldquo;Either Religion is a
fact or it is not! That is, either the curates are free or they are
not! The country is going to ruin, it is lost!&rdquo; And again he
struck the arm of his chair.</p>
<p class="par">Everybody in the sala turned toward the group with
astonished looks. The Dominican raised his head to stare at the
Franciscan from under his glasses. The two foreigners paused a moment,
stared with an expression of mingled severity and reproof, then
immediately continued their promenade.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a bad humor because you
haven&rsquo;t treated him with deference,&rdquo; murmured Se&ntilde;or
Laruja into the ear of the rubicund youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does your Reverence mean? What&rsquo;s the
trouble?&rdquo; inquired the Dominican and the lieutenant at the same
time, but in different tones.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why so many calamities come! The
ruling powers support heretics against the ministers of God!&rdquo;
continued the Franciscan, raising his heavy fists.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1430" href=
"#xd24e1430" name="xd24e1430">11</a>]</span>&ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo; again inquired the frowning lieutenant, half rising from
his chair.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do I mean?&rdquo; repeated Fray Damaso,
raising his voice and facing the lieutenant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I mean. I, yes I, mean to say that when a priest throws out of his
cemetery the corpse of a heretic, no one, not even the King himself,
has any right to interfere and much less to impose any punishment! But
a little General&mdash;a little General Calamity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre, his Excellency is the Vice-Regal
Patron!&rdquo; shouted the soldier, rising to his feet.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Excellency! Vice-Regal Patron! What of
that!&rdquo; retorted the Franciscan, also rising. &ldquo;In other
times he would have been dragged down a staircase as the religious
orders once did with the impious Governor Bustamente.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1439src" href="#xd24e1439" name="xd24e1439src">8</a> Those
were indeed the days of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I warn you that I can&rsquo;t permit this! His
Excellency represents his Majesty the King!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;King or rook! What difference does that make? For
us there is no king other than the legitimate<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1452src" href="#xd24e1452" name=
"xd24e1452src">9</a>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; shouted the lieutenant in a
threatening tone, as if he were commanding his soldiers. &ldquo;Either
you withdraw what you have said or tomorrow I will report it to his
Excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go ahead&mdash;right now&mdash;go on!&rdquo; was
the sarcastic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1459" href=
"#xd24e1459" name="xd24e1459">12</a>]</span>rejoinder of Fray Damaso as
he approached the officer with clenched fists. &ldquo;Do you think that
because I wear the cloth, I&rsquo;m afraid? Go now, while I can lend
you my carriage!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The dispute was taking a ludicrous turn, but fortunately
the Dominican intervened. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he began in an
authoritative tone and with the nasal twang that so well becomes the
friars, &ldquo;you must not confuse things or seek for offenses where
there are none. We must distinguish in the words of Fray Damaso those
of the man from those of the priest. The latter, as such, <i lang=
"la">per se</i>, can never give offense, because they spring from
absolute truth, while in those of the man there is a secondary
distinction to be made: those which he utters <i lang="la">ab
irato</i>, those which he utters <i lang="la">ex ore</i>, but not
<i lang="la">in corde</i>, and those which he does utter <i lang=
"la">in corde</i>. These last are the only ones that can really offend,
and only according to whether they preexisted as a motive <i lang=
"la">in mente</i>, or arose solely <i lang="la">per accidens</i> in the
heat of the discussion, if there really exist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I, by <i lang="la">accidens</i> and for my
own part, understand his motives, Padre Sibyla,&rdquo; broke in the old
soldier, who saw himself about to be entangled in so many distinctions
that he feared lest he might still be held to blame. &ldquo;I
understand the motives about which your Reverence is going to make
distinctions. During the absence of Padre Damaso from San Diego, his
coadjutor buried the body of an extremely worthy individual&mdash;yes,
sir, extremely worthy, for I had had dealings with him many times and
had been entertained in his house. What if he never went to confession,
what does that matter? Neither do I go to confession! But to say that
he committed suicide is a lie, a slander! A man such as he was, who has
a son upon whom he centers his affection and hopes, a man who has faith
in God, who recognizes his duties to society, a just and honorable man,
does not commit suicide. This much I will say and will refrain from
expressing the rest of my thoughts here, so please your
Reverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1491" href=
"#xd24e1491" name="xd24e1491">13</a>]</span>Then, turning his back on
the Franciscan, he went on: &ldquo;Now then, this priest on his return
to the town, after maltreating the poor coadjutor, had the corpse dug
up and taken away from the cemetery to be buried I don&rsquo;t know
where. The people of San Diego were cowardly enough not to protest,
although it is true that few knew of the outrage. The dead man had no
relatives there and his only son was in Europe. But his Excellency
learned of the affair and as he is an upright man asked for some
punishment&mdash;and Padre Damaso was transferred to a better town.
That&rsquo;s all there is to it. Now your Reverence can make your
distinctions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So saying, he withdrew from the group.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I inadvertently brought up
so delicate a subject,&rdquo; said Padre Sibyla sadly. &ldquo;But,
after all, if there has been a gain in the change of
towns&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How is there to be a gain? And what of all the
things that are lost in moving, the letters, and the&mdash;and
everything that is mislaid?&rdquo; interrupted Fray Damaso, stammering
in the vain effort to control his anger.</p>
<p class="par">Little by little the party resumed its former
tranquillity. Other guests had come in, among them a lame old Spaniard
of mild and inoffensive aspect leaning on the arm of an elderly
Filipina, who was resplendent in frizzes and paint and a European gown.
The group welcomed them heartily, and Doctor De Espada&ntilde;a and his
se&ntilde;ora, the <i>Doctora</i> Do&ntilde;a Victorina, took their
seats among our acquaintances. Some newspaper reporters and shopkeepers
greeted one another and moved about aimlessly without knowing just what
to do.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But can you tell me, Se&ntilde;or Laruja, what
kind of man our host is?&rdquo; inquired the rubicund youth. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t been introduced to him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They say that he has gone out. I haven&rsquo;t
seen him either.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of introductions
here,&rdquo; volunteered Fray Damaso. &ldquo;Santiago is made of the
right stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1512" href=
"#xd24e1512" name="xd24e1512">14</a>]</span>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not

Laruja.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You too, Se&ntilde;or Laruja,&rdquo; exclaimed
Do&ntilde;a Victorina in mild reproach, as she fanned herself.
&ldquo;How could the poor man invent gunpowder if, as is said, the
Chinese invented it centuries ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Chinese! Are you crazy?&rdquo; cried Fray
Damaso. &ldquo;Out with you! A Franciscan, one of my Order, Fray
What-do-you-call-him Savalls,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1521src" href=
"#xd24e1521" name="xd24e1521src">11</a> invented it in the&mdash;ah the
seventh century!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A Franciscan? Well, he must have been a
missionary in China, that Padre Savalls,&rdquo; replied the lady, who
did not thus easily part from her beliefs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Schwartz,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1528src"
href="#xd24e1528" name="xd24e1528src">12</a> perhaps you mean,
se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; said Fray Sibyla, without looking at her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Fray Damaso said a Franciscan
and I was only repeating.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, Savalls or Chevas, what does it matter? The
difference of a letter doesn&rsquo;t make him a Chinaman,&rdquo;
replied the Franciscan in bad humor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And in the fourteenth century, not the
seventh,&rdquo; added the Dominican in a tone of correction, as if to
mortify the pride of the other friar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, neither does a century more or less make
him a Dominican.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry, your Reverence,&rdquo;
admonished Padre Sibyla, smiling. &ldquo;So much the better that he did
invent it so as to save his brethren the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And did you say, Padre Sibyla, that it was in the
fourteenth century?&rdquo; asked Do&ntilde;a Victorina with great
interest. &ldquo;Was that before or after Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fortunately for the individual questioned, two persons
entered the room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1546" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter II</h2>
<h2 class="main">Crisostomo Ibarra</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was not two beautiful and well-gowned young
women that attracted the attention of all, even including Fray Sibyla,
nor was it his Excellency the Captain-General with his staff, that the
lieutenant should start from his abstraction and take a couple of steps
forward, or that Fray Damaso should look as if turned to stone; it was
simply the original of the oil-painting leading by the hand a young man
dressed in deep mourning.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good evening, gentlemen! Good evening,
Padre!&rdquo; were the greetings of Capitan Tiago as he kissed the
hands of the priests, who forgot to bestow upon him their benediction.
The Dominican had taken off his glasses to stare at the newly arrived
youth, while Fray Damaso was pale and unnaturally wide-eyed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have the honor of presenting to you Don
Crisostomo Ibarra, the son of my deceased friend,&rdquo; went on
Capitan Tiago. &ldquo;The young gentleman has just arrived from Europe
and I went to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At the mention of the name exclamations were heard. The
lieutenant forgot to pay his respects to his host and approached the
young man, looking him over from head to foot. The young man himself at
that moment was exchanging the conventional greetings with all in the
group, nor did there seem to be any thing extraordinary about him
except his mourning garments in the center of that brilliantly lighted
room. Yet in spite of them his remarkable stature, his features, and
his movements breathed forth an air of healthy youthfulness in which
both body and mind had equally developed. There might have been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1560" href="#xd24e1560" name=
"xd24e1560">16</a>]</span>noticed in his frank, pleasant face some
faint traces of Spanish blood showing through a beautiful brown color,
slightly flushed at the cheeks as a result perhaps of his residence in
cold countries.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed with joyful surprise,
&ldquo;the curate of my native town! Padre Damaso, my father&rsquo;s
intimate friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Every look in the room was directed toward the
Franciscan, who made no movement.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me, perhaps I&rsquo;m mistaken,&rdquo;
added Ibarra, embarrassed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are not mistaken,&rdquo; the friar was at
last able to articulate in a changed voice, &ldquo;but your father was
never an intimate friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra slowly withdrew his extended hand, looking
greatly surprised, and turned to encounter the gloomy gaze of the
lieutenant fixed on him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Young man, are you the son of Don Rafael
Ibarra?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">The youth bowed. Fray Damaso partly rose in his chair
and stared fixedly at the lieutenant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Welcome back to your country! And may you be
happier in it than your father was!&rdquo; exclaimed the officer in a
trembling voice. &ldquo;I knew him well and can say that he was one of
the worthiest and most honorable men in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, deeply moved,
&ldquo;the praise you bestow upon my father removes my doubts about the
manner of his death, of which I, his son, am yet ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The eyes of the old soldier filled with tears and
turning away hastily he withdrew. The young man thus found himself
alone in the center of the room. His host having disappeared, he saw no
one who might introduce him to the young ladies, many of whom were
watching him with interest. After a few moments of hesitation he
started toward them in a simple and natural manner.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to overstep the
rules of strict <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1585" href=
"#xd24e1585" name="xd24e1585">17</a>]</span>etiquette. It has been
seven years since I have been in my own country and upon returning to
it I cannot suppress my admiration and refrain from paying my respects
to its most precious ornaments, the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But as none of them ventured a reply, he found himself
obliged to retire. He then turned toward a group of men who, upon
seeing him approach, arranged themselves in a semicircle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he addressed them, &ldquo;it is
a custom in Germany, when a stranger finds himself at a function and
there is no one to introduce him to those present, that he give his
name and so introduce himself. Allow me to adopt this usage here, not
to introduce foreign customs when our own are so beautiful, but because
I find myself driven to it by necessity. I have already paid my
respects to the skies and to the ladies of my native land; now I wish
to greet its citizens, my fellow-countrymen. Gentlemen, my name is Juan
Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The others gave their names, more or less obscure, and
unimportant here.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My name is A&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said one youth
dryly, as he made a slight bow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I have the honor of addressing the poet
whose works have done so much to keep up my enthusiasm for my native
land. It is said that you do not write any more, but I could not learn
the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The reason? Because one does not seek inspiration
in order to debase himself and lie. One writer has been imprisoned for
having put a very obvious truth into verse. They may have called me a
poet but they sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t call me a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And may I enquire what that truth was?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He said that the lion&rsquo;s son is also a lion.
He came very near to being exiled for it,&rdquo; replied the strange
youth, moving away from the group.</p>
<p class="par">A man with a smiling face, dressed in the fashion of the
natives of the country, with diamond studs in his shirt-bosom,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1606" href="#xd24e1606" name=
"xd24e1606">18</a>]</span>came up at that moment almost running. He
went directly to Ibarra and grasped his hand, saying,
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, I&rsquo;ve been eager to make your
acquaintance. Capitan Tiago is a friend of mine and I knew your
respected father. I am known as Capitan Tinong and live in Tondo, where
you will always be welcome. I hope that you will honor me with a visit.
Come and dine with us tomorrow.&rdquo; He smiled and rubbed his
hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, warmly, charmed
with such amiability, &ldquo;but tomorrow morning I must leave for San
Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How unfortunate! Then it will be on your
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dinner is served!&rdquo; announced a waiter from
the caf&eacute; La Campana, and the guests began to file out toward the
table, the women, especially the Filipinas, with great hesitation.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Fray Sibyla seemed to be very content as he moved
along tranquilly with the look of disdain no longer playing about his
thin, refined lips. He even condescended to speak to the lame doctor,
De Espada&ntilde;a, who answered in monosyllables only, as he was
somewhat of a stutterer. The Franciscan was in a frightful humor,
kicking at the chairs and even elbowing a cadet out of his way. The
lieutenant was grave while the others talked vivaciously, praising the
magnificence of the table. Do&ntilde;a Victorina, however, was just
turning up her nose in disdain when she suddenly became as furious as a
trampled serpent&mdash;the lieutenant had stepped on the train of her
gown.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any eyes?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;ora, two better than yours, but
the fact is that I was admiring your frizzes,&rdquo; retorted the
rather ungallant soldier as he moved away from her.</p>
<p class="par">As if from instinct the two friars both started toward
the head of the table, perhaps from habit, and then, as might have been
expected, the same thing happened that occurs with the competitors for
a university position, who openly exalt the qualifications and
superiority of their opponents, later giving to understand that just
the contrary was meant, and who murmur and grumble when they do not
receive the appointment.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1634" href=
"#xd24e1634" name="xd24e1634">20</a>]</span>&ldquo;For you, Fray
Damaso.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For you, Fray Sibyla.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An older friend of the family&mdash;confessor of
the deceased lady&mdash;age, dignity, and authority&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not so very old, either! On the other hand, you
are the curate of the district,&rdquo; replied Fray Damaso sourly,
without taking his hand from the back of the chair.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since you command it, I obey,&rdquo; concluded
Fray Sibyla, disposing himself to take the seat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t command it!&rdquo; protested the
Franciscan. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t command it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Sibyla was about to seat himself without paying any
more attention to these protests when his eyes happened to encounter
those of the lieutenant. According to clerical opinion in the
Philippines, the highest secular official is inferior to a friar-cook:
<i>cedant arma togae</i>, said Cicero in the Senate&mdash;<i>cedant
arma cottae</i>, say the friars in the Philippines.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1655src" href="#xd24e1655" name="xd24e1655src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">But Fray Sibyla was a well-bred person, so he said,
&ldquo;Lieutenant, here we are in the world and not in the church. The
seat of honor belongs to you.&rdquo; To judge from the tone of his
voice, however, even in the world it really did belong to him, and the
lieutenant, either to keep out of trouble or to avoid sitting between
two friars, curtly declined.</p>
<p class="par">None of the claimants had given a thought to their host.
Ibarra noticed him watching the scene with a smile of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Don Santiago, aren&rsquo;t you
going to sit down with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But all the seats were occupied; Lucullus was not to sup
in the house of Lucullus.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sit still, don&rsquo;t get up!&rdquo; said
Capitan Tiago, placing his hand on the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;This fiesta is for the special purpose of giving thanks to the
Virgin for your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1668" href=
"#xd24e1668" name="xd24e1668">21</a>]</span>safe arrival. <i>Oy!</i>
Bring on the <i>tinola!</i> I ordered <i>tinola</i> as you doubtless
have not tasted any for so long a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A large steaming tureen was brought in. The Dominican,
after muttering the benedicite, to which scarcely any one knew how to
respond, began to serve the contents. But whether from carelessness or
other cause, Padre Damaso received a plate in which a bare neck and a
tough wing of chicken floated about in a large quantity of soup amid
lumps of squash, while the others were eating legs and breasts,
especially Ibarra, to whose lot fell the second joints. Observing all
this, the Franciscan mashed up some pieces of squash, barely tasted the
soup, dropped his spoon noisily, and roughly pushed his plate away. The
Dominican was very busy talking to the rubicund youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How long have you been away from the
country?&rdquo; Laruja asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Almost seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then you have probably forgotten all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite the contrary. Even if my country does seem
to have forgotten me, I have always thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How do you mean that it has forgotten you?&rdquo;
inquired the rubicund youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I mean that it has been a year since I have
received any news from here, so that I find myself a stranger who does
not yet know how and when his father died.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This statement drew a sudden exclamation from the
lieutenant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And where were you that you didn&rsquo;t
telegraph?&rdquo; asked Do&ntilde;a Victorina. &ldquo;When we were
married we telegraphed to the Pe&ntilde;insula.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1698src" href="#xd24e1698" name=
"xd24e1698src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, for the past two years I have been
in the northern part of Europe, in Germany and Russian
Poland.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Doctor De Espada&ntilde;a, who until now had not
ventured upon any conversation, thought this a good opportunity to say
something. &ldquo;I&mdash;I knew in S-spain a P-pole from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1714" href="#xd24e1714" name=
"xd24e1714">22</a>]</span>W-warsaw, c-called S-stadtnitzki, if I
r-remember c-correctly. P-perhaps you s-saw him?&rdquo; he asked
timidly and almost blushingly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; answered Ibarra in
a friendly manner, &ldquo;but just at this moment I don&rsquo;t recall
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;B-but you c-couldn&rsquo;t have c-confused him
with any one else,&rdquo; went on the Doctor, taking courage. &ldquo;He
was r-ruddy as gold and t-talked Spanish very b-badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Those are good clues, but unfortunately while
there I talked Spanish only in a few consulates.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How then did you get along?&rdquo; asked the
wondering Do&ntilde;a Victorina.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The language of the country served my needs,
madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you also speak English?&rdquo; inquired the
Dominican, who had been in Hongkong, and who was a master of
pidgin-English, that adulteration of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tongue used by
the sons of the Celestial Empire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I stayed in England a year among people who
talked nothing but English.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Which country of Europe pleased you the
most?&rdquo; asked the rubicund youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After Spain, my second fatherland, any country of
free Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you who seem to have traveled so much, tell
us what do you consider the most notable thing that you have
seen?&rdquo; inquired Laruja.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra appeared to reflect. &ldquo;Notable&mdash;in what
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For example, in regard to the life of the
people&mdash;the social, political, religious life&mdash;in general, in
its essential features&mdash;as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra paused thoughtfully before replying.
&ldquo;Frankly, I like everything in those people, setting aside the
national pride of each one. But before visiting a country, I tried to
familiarize myself with its history, its Exodus, if I may so speak, and
afterwards I found everything quite natural. I have observed that the
prosperity or misery of each people is in direct proportion to its
liberties or its prejudices and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e1743" href="#xd24e1743" name=
"xd24e1743">23</a>]</span>accordingly, to the sacrifices or the
selfishness of its forefathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t you observed anything more than
that?&rdquo; broke in the Franciscan with a sneer. Since the beginning
of the dinner he had not uttered a single word, his whole attention
having been taking up, no doubt, with the food. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t
worth while to squander your fortune to learn so trifling a thing. Any
schoolboy knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra was placed in an embarrassing position, and the
rest looked from one to the other as if fearing a disagreeable scene.
He was about to say, &ldquo;The dinner is nearly over and his Reverence
is now satiated,&rdquo; but restrained himself and merely remarked to
the others, &ldquo;Gentlemen, don&rsquo;t be surprised at the
familiarity with which our former curate treats me. He treated me so
when I was a child, and the years seem to make no difference in his
Reverence. I appreciate it, too, because it recalls the days when his
Reverence visited our home and honored my father&rsquo;s
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Dominican glanced furtively at the Franciscan, who
was trembling visibly. Ibarra continued as he rose from the table:
&ldquo;You will now permit me to retire, since, as I have just arrived
and must go away tomorrow morning, there remain some important business
matters for me to attend to. The principal part of the dinner is over
and I drink but little wine and seldom touch cordials. Gentlemen, all
for Spain and the Philippines!&rdquo; Saying this, he drained his
glass, which he had not before touched. The old lieutenant silently
followed his example.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; whispered Capitan Tiago.
&ldquo;Maria Clara will be here. Isabel has gone to get her. The new
curate of your town, who is a saint, is also coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call tomorrow before starting.
I&rsquo;ve a very important visit to make now.&rdquo; With this he went
away.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile the Franciscan had recovered himself.
&ldquo;Do you see?&rdquo; he said to the rubicund youth, at the same
time flourishing his dessert spoon. &ldquo;That comes from pride. They
can&rsquo;t stand to have the curate correct them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1758" href="#xd24e1758" name=
"xd24e1758">24</a>]</span>They even think that they are respectable
persons. It&rsquo;s the evil result of sending young men to Europe. The
government ought to prohibit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And how about the lieutenant?&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a
Victorina chimed in upon the Franciscan, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t get the
frown off his face the whole evening. He did well to leave us so old
and still only a lieutenant!&rdquo; The lady could not forget the
allusion to her frizzes and the trampled ruffles of her gown.</p>
<p class="par">That night the rubicund youth wrote down, among other
things, the following title for a chapter in his <i>Colonial
Studies</i>: &ldquo;Concerning the manner in which the neck and wing of
a chicken in a friar&rsquo;s plate of soup may disturb the merriment of
a feast.&rdquo; Among his notes there appeared these observations:
&ldquo;In the Philippines the most unnecessary person at a dinner is he
who gives it, for they are quite capable of beginning by throwing the
host into the street and then everything will go on smoothly. Under
present conditions it would perhaps be a good thing not to allow the
Filipinos to leave the country, and even not to teach them to
read.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1767" href="#xd24e1767"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ibarra stood undecided for a moment. The night
breeze, which during those months blows cool enough in Manila, seemed
to drive from his forehead the light cloud that had darkened it. He
took off his hat and drew a deep breath. Carriages flashed by, public
rigs moved along at a sleepy pace, pedestrians of many nationalities
were passing. He walked along at that irregular pace which indicates
thoughtful abstraction or freedom from care, directing his steps toward
Binondo Plaza and looking about him as if to recall the place. There
were the same streets and the identical houses with their white and
blue walls, whitewashed, or frescoed in bad imitation of granite; the
church continued to show its illuminated clock face; there were the
same Chinese shops with their soiled curtains and their iron gratings,
in one of which was a bar that he, in imitation of the street urchins
of Manila, had twisted one night; it was still unstraightened.
&ldquo;How slowly everything moves,&rdquo; he murmured as he turned
into Calle Sacristia. The ice-cream venders were repeating the same
shrill cry, &ldquo;<i>Sorbeteee!</i>&rdquo; while the smoky lamps still
lighted the identical Chinese stands and those of the old women who
sold candy and fruit.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the same Chinese who was here seven years ago, and
that old woman&mdash;the very same! It might be said that tonight
I&rsquo;ve dreamed of a seven years&rsquo; journey in Europe. Good
heavens, that pavement is still in the same unrepaired condition as
when I left!&rdquo; True it was that the stones of the sidewalk on the
corner of San Jacinto and Sacristia were still loose.</p>
<p class="par">While he was meditating upon this marvel of the
city&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1782" href="#xd24e1782"
name="xd24e1782">26</a>]</span>stability in a country where everything
is so unstable, a hand was placed lightly on his shoulder. He raised
his head to see the old lieutenant gazing at him with something like a
smile in place of the hard expression and the frown which usually
characterized him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Young man, be careful! Learn from your
father!&rdquo; was the abrupt greeting of the old soldier.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me, but you seem to have thought a great
deal of my father. Can you tell me how he died?&rdquo; asked Ibarra,
staring at him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you know about it?&rdquo; asked
the officer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I asked Don Santiago about it, but he
wouldn&rsquo;t promise to tell me until tomorrow. Perhaps you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should say I do, as does everybody else. He
died in prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The young man stepped backward a pace and gazed
searchingly at the lieutenant. &ldquo;In prison? Who died in
prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your father, man, since he was in
confinement,&rdquo; was the somewhat surprised answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My father&mdash;in prison&mdash;confined in a
prison? What are you talking about? Do you know who my father was? Are
you&mdash;?&rdquo; demanded the young man, seizing the officer&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I rather think that I&rsquo;m not mistaken. He
was Don Rafael Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, Don Rafael Ibarra,&rdquo; echoed the youth
weakly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I thought you knew about it,&rdquo;
muttered the soldier in a tone of compassion as he saw what was passing
in Ibarra&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I supposed that you&mdash;but be brave!
Here one cannot be honest and keep out of jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I must believe that you are not joking with
me,&rdquo; replied Ibarra in a weak voice, after a few moments&rsquo;
silence. &ldquo;Can you tell me why he was in prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man seemed to be perplexed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
strange to me that your family affairs were not made known to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His last letter, a year ago, said that I should
not be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1813" href="#xd24e1813" name=
"xd24e1813">27</a>]</span>uneasy if he did not write, as he was very
busy. He charged me to continue my studies and&mdash;sent me his
blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then he wrote that letter to you just before he
died. It will soon be a year since we buried him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But why was my father a prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For a very honorable reason. But come with me to
the barracks and I&rsquo;ll tell you as we go along. Take my
arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They moved along for some time in silence. The elder
seemed to be in deep thought and to be seeking inspiration from his
goatee, which he stroked continually.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As you well know,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;your
father was the richest man in the province, and while many loved and
respected him, there were also some who envied and hated him. We
Spaniards who come to the Philippines are unfortunately not all we
ought to be. I say this as much on account of one of your ancestors as
on account of your father&rsquo;s enemies. The continual changes, the
corruption in the higher circles, the favoritism, the low cost and the
shortness of the journey, are to blame for it all. The worst characters
of the Peninsula come here, and even if a good man does come, the
country soon ruins him. So it was that your father had a number of
enemies among the curates and other Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here he hesitated for a while. &ldquo;Some months after
your departure the troubles with Padre Damaso began, but I am unable to
explain the real cause of them. Fray Damaso accused him of not coming
to confession, although he had not done so formerly and they had
nevertheless been good friends, as you may still remember. Moreover,
Don Rafael was a very upright man, more so than many of those who
regularly attend confession and than the confessors themselves. He had
framed for himself a rigid morality and often said to me, when he
talked of these troubles, &lsquo;Se&ntilde;or Guevara, do you believe
that God will pardon any crime, a murder for instance, solely by a
man&rsquo;s telling it to a priest&mdash;a man after all and one whose
duty it is to keep quiet about it&mdash;by his fearing that he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1828" href="#xd24e1828" name=
"xd24e1828">28</a>]</span>will roast in hell as a penance&mdash;by
being cowardly and certainly shameless into the bargain? I have another
conception of God,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;for in my opinion one
evil does not correct another, nor is a crime to be expiated by vain
lamentings or by giving alms to the Church. Take this example: if I
have killed the father of a family, if I have made of a woman a
sorrowing widow and destitute orphans of some happy children, have I
satisfied eternal Justice by letting myself be hanged, or by entrusting
my secret to one who is obliged to guard it for me, or by giving alms
to priests who are least in need of them, or by buying indulgences and
lamenting night and day? What of the widow and the orphans? My
conscience tells me that I should try to take the place of him whom I
killed, that I should dedicate my whole life to the welfare of the
family whose misfortunes I caused. But even so, who can replace the
love of a husband and a father?&rsquo; Thus your father reasoned and by
this strict standard of conduct regulated all his actions, so that it
can be said that he never injured anybody. On the contrary, he
endeavored by his good deeds to wipe out some injustices which he said
your ancestors had committed. But to get back to his troubles with the
curate&mdash;these took on a serious aspect. Padre Damaso denounced him
from the pulpit, and that he did not expressly name him was a miracle,
since anything might have been expected of such a character. I foresaw
that sooner or later the affair would have serious results.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Again the old lieutenant paused. &ldquo;There happened
to be wandering about the province an ex-artilleryman who has been
discharged from the army on account of his stupidity and ignorance. As
the man had to live and he was not permitted to engage in manual labor,
which would injure our prestige, he somehow or other obtained a
position as collector of the tax on vehicles. The poor devil had no
education at all, a fact of which the natives soon became aware, as it
was a marvel for them to see a Spaniard who didn&rsquo;t know how to
read and write. Every one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1832"
href="#xd24e1832" name="xd24e1832">29</a>]</span>ridiculed him and the
payment of the tax was the occasion of broad smiles. He knew that he
was an object of ridicule and this tended to sour his disposition even
more, rough and bad as it had formerly been. They would purposely hand
him the papers upside down to see his efforts to read them, and
wherever he found a blank space he would scribble a lot of pothooks
which rather fitly passed for his signature. The natives mocked while
they paid him. He swallowed his pride and made the collections, but was
in such a state of mind that he had no respect for any one. He even
came to have some hard words with your father.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One day it happened that he was in a shop turning
a document over and over in the effort to get it straight when a
schoolboy began to make signs to his companions and to point laughingly
at the collector with his finger. The fellow heard the laughter and saw
the joke reflected in the solemn faces of the bystanders. He lost his
patience and, turning quickly, started to chase the boys, who ran away
shouting <i>ba, be, bi, bo, bu</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1839src"
href="#xd24e1839" name="xd24e1839src">1</a> Blind with rage and unable
to catch them, he threw his cane and struck one of the boys on the
head, knocking him down. He ran up and began to kick the fallen boy,
and none of those who had been laughing had the courage to interfere.
Unfortunately, your father happened to come along just at that time. He
ran forward indignantly, caught the collector by the arm, and
reprimanded him severely. The artilleryman, who was no doubt beside
himself with rage, raised his hand, but your father was too quick for
him, and with the strength of a descendant of the Basques&mdash;some
say that he struck him, others that he merely pushed him, but at any
rate the man staggered and fell a little way off, striking his head
against a stone. Don Rafael quietly picked the wounded boy up and
carried him to the town hall. The artilleryman bled freely from the
mouth and died a few moments later without recovering
consciousness.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1843" href=
"#xd24e1843" name="xd24e1843">30</a>]</span>&ldquo;As was to be
expected, the authorities intervened and arrested your father. All his
hidden enemies at once rose up and false accusations came from all
sides. He was accused of being a heretic and a filibuster. To be a
heretic is a great danger anywhere, but especially so at that time when
the province was governed by an alcalde who made a great show of his
piety, who with his servants used to recite his rosary in the church in
a loud voice, perhaps that all might hear and pray with him. But to be
a filibuster is worse than to be a heretic and to kill three or four
tax-collectors who know how to read, write, and attend to business.
Every one abandoned him, and his books and papers were seized. He was
accused of subscribing to <i lang="es">El Correo de Ultramar</i>, and
to newspapers from Madrid, of having sent you to Germany, of having in
his possession letters and a photograph of a priest who had been
legally executed, and I don&rsquo;t know what not. Everything served as
an accusation, even the fact that he, a descendant of Peninsulars, wore
a camisa. Had it been any one but your father, it is likely that he
would soon have been set free, as there was a physician who ascribed
the death of the unfortunate collector to a hemorrhage. But his wealth,
his confidence in the law, and his hatred of everything that was not
legal and just, wrought his undoing. In spite of my repugnance to
asking for mercy from any one, I applied personally to the
Captain-General&mdash;the predecessor of our present one&mdash;and
urged upon him that there could not be anything of the filibuster about
a man who took up with all the Spaniards, even the poor emigrants, and
gave them food and shelter, and in whose veins yet flowed the generous
blood of Spain. It was in vain that I pledged my life and swore by my
poverty and my military honor. I succeeded only in being coldly

a deep breath, and after noticing the silence of his companion, who was
listening with averted face, continued: &ldquo;At your father&rsquo;s
request I prepared the defense in the case. I went first to the
celebrated Filipino lawyer, young A&mdash;&mdash;, but he refused to
take the case. &lsquo;I should lose it,&rsquo; he told me, &lsquo;and
my defending him would furnish the motive for another charge against
him and perhaps one against me. Go to Se&ntilde;or M&mdash;&mdash;, who
is a forceful and fluent speaker and a Peninsular of great
influence.&rsquo; I did so, and the noted lawyer took charge of the
case, and conducted it with mastery and brilliance. But your
father&rsquo;s enemies were numerous, some of them hidden and unknown.
False witnesses abounded, and their calumnies, which under other
circumstances would have melted away before a sarcastic phrase from the
defense, here assumed shape and substance. If the lawyer succeeded in
destroying the force of their testimony by making them contradict each
other and even perjure themselves, new charges were at once preferred.
They accused him of having illegally taken possession of a great deal
of land and demanded damages. They said that he maintained relations
with the tulisanes in order that his crops and animals might not be
molested by them. At last the case became so confused that at the end
of a year no one understood it. The alcalde had to leave and there came
in his place one who had the reputation of being honest, but
unfortunately he stayed only a few months, and his successor was too
fond of good horses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The sufferings, the worries, the hard life in the
prison, or the pain of seeing so much ingratitude, broke your
father&rsquo;s iron constitution and he fell ill with that malady which
only the tomb can cure. When the case was almost finished and he was
about to be acquitted of the charge of being an enemy of the fatherland
and of being the murderer of the tax-collector, he died in the prison
with no one at his side. I arrived just in time to see him breathe his
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1860" href=
"#xd24e1860" name="xd24e1860">32</a>]</span>The old lieutenant became
silent, but still Ibarra said nothing. They had arrived meanwhile at
the door of the barracks, so the soldier stopped and said, as he
grasped the youth&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;Young man, for details ask
Capitan Tiago. Now, good night, as I must return to duty and see that
all&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Silently, but with great feeling, Ibarra shook the
lieutenant&rsquo;s bony hand and followed him with his eyes until he
disappeared. Then he turned slowly and signaled to a passing carriage.
&ldquo;To Lala&rsquo;s Hotel,&rdquo; was the direction he gave in a
scarcely audible voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This fellow must have just got out of
jail,&rdquo; thought the cochero as he whipped up his horses.

<p class="par first">Ibarra went to his room, which overlooked the
river, and dropping into a chair gazed out into the vast expanse of the
heavens spread before him through the open window. The house on the
opposite bank was profusely lighted, and gay strains of music, largely
from stringed instruments, were borne across the river even to his
room.</p>
<p class="par">If the young man had been less preoccupied, if he had
had more curiosity and had cared to see with his opera glasses what was
going on in that atmosphere of light, he would have been charmed with
one of those magical and fantastic spectacles, the like of which is
sometimes seen in the great theaters of Europe. To the subdued strains
of the orchestra there seems to appear in the midst of a shower of
light, a cascade of gold and diamonds in an Oriental setting, a deity
wrapped in misty gauze, a sylph enveloped in a luminous halo, who moves
forward apparently without touching the floor. In her presence the
flowers bloom, the dance awakens, the music bursts forth, and troops of
devils, nymphs, satyrs, demons, angels, shepherds and shepherdesses,
dance, shake their tambourines, and whirl about in rhythmic evolutions,
each one placing some tribute at the feet of the goddess. Ibarra would
have seen a beautiful and graceful maiden, clothed in the picturesque
garments of the daughters of the Philippines, standing in the center Of
a semicircle made up of every class of people, Chinese, Spaniards,
Filipinos, soldiers, curates, old men and young, all gesticulating and
moving about in a lively manner. Padre Damaso stood at the side of the
beauty, smiling like one especially blessed. Fray Sibyla&mdash;yes,
Fray Sibyla <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1876" href="#xd24e1876"
name="xd24e1876">34</a>]</span>himself&mdash;was talking to her.
Do&ntilde;a Victorina was arranging in the magnificent hair of the
maiden a string of pearls and diamonds which threw out all the
beautiful tints of the rainbow. She was white, perhaps too much so, and
whenever she raised her downcast eyes there shone forth a spotless
soul. When she smiled so as to show her small white teeth the beholder
realized that the rose is only a flower and ivory but the
elephant&rsquo;s tusk. From out the filmy pi&ntilde;a draperies around
her white and shapely neck there blinked, as the Tagalogs say, the
bright eyes of a collar of diamonds. One man only in all the crowd
seemed insensible to her radiant influence&mdash;a young Franciscan,
thin, wasted, and pale, who watched her from a distance, motionless as
a statue and scarcely breathing.</p>
<p class="par">But Ibarra saw nothing of all this&mdash;his eyes were
fixed on other things. A small space was enclosed by four bare and
grimy walls, in one of which was an iron grating. On the filthy and
loathsome floor was a mat upon which an old man lay alone in the throes
of death, an old man breathing with difficulty and turning his head
from side to side as amid his tears he uttered a name. The old man was
alone, but from time to time a groan or the rattle of a chain was heard
on the other side of the wall. Far away there was a merry feast, almost
an orgy; a youth was laughing, shouting, and pouring wine upon the
flowers amid the applause and drunken laughter of his companions. The
old man had the features of <i>his</i> father, the youth was himself,
and the name that the old man uttered with tears was <i>his own</i>
name! This was what the wretched young man saw before him. The lights
in the house opposite were extinguished, the music and the noises
ceased, but Ibarra still heard the anguished cry of his father calling
upon his son in the hour of his death.</p>
<p class="par">Silence had now blown its hollow breath over the city,
and all things seemed to sleep in the embrace of nothingness. The
cock-crow alternated with the strokes of the clocks in the church
towers and the mournful cries of the weary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1888" href="#xd24e1888" name=
"xd24e1888">35</a>]</span>sentinels. A waning moon began to appear, and
everything seemed to be at rest; even Ibarra himself, worn out by his
sad thoughts or by his journey, now slept.</p>
<p class="par">Only the young Franciscan whom we saw not so long ago
standing motionless and silent in the midst of the gaiety of the
ballroom slept not, but kept vigil. In his cell, with his elbow upon
the window sill and his pale, worn cheek resting on the palm of his
hand, he was gazing silently into the distance where a bright star
glittered in the dark sky. The star paled and disappeared, the dim
light of the waning moon faded, but the friar did not move from his
place&mdash;he was gazing out over the field of Bagumbayan and the
sleeping sea at the far horizon wrapped in the morning mist.

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="par first">Thy will be done on earth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">While our characters are deep in slumber or busy
with their breakfasts, let us turn our attention to Capitan Tiago. We
have never had the honor of being his guest, so it is neither our right
nor our duty to pass him by slightingly, even under the stress of
important events.</p>
<p class="par">Low in stature, with a clear complexion, a corpulent
figure and a full face, thanks to the liberal supply of fat which
according to his admirers was the gift of Heaven and which his enemies
averred was the blood of the poor, Capitan Tiago appeared to be younger
than he really was; he might have been thought between thirty and
thirty-five years of age. At the time of our story his countenance
always wore a sanctified look; his little round head, covered with
ebony-black hair cut long in front and short behind, was reputed to
contain many things of weight; his eyes, small but with no Chinese
slant, never varied in expression; his nose was slender and not at all
inclined to flatness; and if his mouth had not been disfigured by the
immoderate use of tobacco and buyo, which, when chewed and gathered in
one cheek, marred the symmetry of his features, we would say that he
might properly have considered himself a handsome man and have passed
for such. Yet in spite of this bad habit he kept marvelously white both
his natural teeth and also the two which the dentist furnished him at
twelve pesos each.</p>
<p class="par">He was considered one of the richest landlords in
Binondo and a planter of some importance by reason of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1907" href="#xd24e1907" name=
"xd24e1907">37</a>]</span>estates in Pampanga and Laguna, principally
in the town of San Diego, the income from which increased with each
year. San Diego, on account of its agreeable baths, its famous cockpit,
and his cherished memories of the place, was his favorite town, so that
he spent at least two months of the year there. His holdings of real
estate in the city were large, and it is superfluous to state that the
opium monopoly controlled by him and a Chinese brought in large
profits. They also had the lucrative contract of feeding the prisoners
in Bilibid and furnished zacate to many of the stateliest
establishments in Manila u through the medium of contracts, of course.
Standing well with all the authorities, clever, cunning, and even bold
in speculating upon the wants of others, he was the only formidable
rival of a certain Perez in the matter of the farming-out of revenues
and the sale of offices and appointments, which the Philippine
government always confides to private persons. Thus, at the time of the
events here narrated, Capitan Tiago was a happy man in so far as it is
possible for a narrow-brained individual to be happy in such a land: he
was rich, and at peace with God, the government, and men.</p>
<p class="par">That he was at peace with God was beyond
doubt,&mdash;almost like religion itself. There is no need to be on bad
terms with the good God when one is prosperous on earth, when one has
never had any direct dealings with Him and has never lent Him any
money. Capitan Tiago himself had never offered any prayers to Him, even
in his greatest difficulties, for he was rich and his gold prayed for
him. For masses and supplications high and powerful priests had been
created; for novenas and rosaries God in His infinite bounty had
created the poor for the service of the rich&mdash;the poor who for a
peso could be secured to recite sixteen mysteries and to read all the
sacred books, even the Hebrew Bible, for a little extra. If at any time
in the midst of pressing difficulties he needed celestial aid and had
not at hand even a red Chinese taper, he would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1911" href="#xd24e1911" name=
"xd24e1911">38</a>]</span>call upon his most adored saints, promising
them many things for the purpose of putting them under obligation to
him and ultimately convincing them of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e1913" title="Source: righteouness">righteousness</span> of his
desires.</p>
<p class="par">The saint to whom he promised the most, and whose
promises he was the most faithful in fulfilling, was the Virgin of
Antipolo, Our Lady of Peace and Prosperous Voyages.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e1918src" href="#xd24e1918" name="xd24e1918src">1</a> With many
of the lesser saints he was not very punctual or even decent; and
sometimes, after having his petitions granted, he thought no more about
them, though of course after such treatment he did not bother them
again, when occasion arose. Capitan Tiago knew that the calendar was
full of idle saints who perhaps had nothing wherewith to occupy their
time up there in heaven. Furthermore, to the Virgin of Antipolo he
ascribed greater power and efficiency than to all the other Virgins
combined, whether they carried silver canes, naked or richly clothed
images of the Christ Child, scapularies, rosaries, or girdles. Perhaps
this reverence was owing to the fact that she was a very strict Lady,
watchful of her name, and, according to the senior sacristan of
Antipolo, an enemy of photography. When she was angered she turned
black as ebony, while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1933" href=
"#xd24e1933" name="xd24e1933">39</a>]</span>the other Virgins were
softer of heart and more indulgent. It is a well-known fact that some
minds love an absolute monarch rather than a constitutional one, as
witness Louis XIV and Louis XVI, Philip II and Amadeo I. This fact
perhaps explains why infidel Chinese and even Spaniards may be seen
kneeling in the famous sanctuary; what is not explained is why the
priests run away with the money of the terrible Image, go to America,
and get married there.</p>
<p class="par">In the sala of Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house, that door,
hidden by a silk curtain leads to a small chapel or oratory such as
must be lacking in no Filipino home. There were placed his household
gods&mdash;and we say &ldquo;gods&rdquo; because he was inclined to
polytheism rather than to monotheism, which he had never come to
understand. There could be seen images of the Holy Family with busts
and extremities of ivory, glass eyes, long eyelashes, and curly blond
hair&mdash;masterpieces of Santa Cruz sculpture. Paintings in oil by
artists of Paco and Ermita<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1937src" href=
"#xd24e1937" name="xd24e1937src">2</a> represented martyrdoms of saints
and miracles of the Virgin; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Lucy
gazing at the sky and carrying in a plate an extra pair of eyes with
lashes and eyebrows, such as are seen painted in the triangle of the
Trinity or on Egyptian tombs; <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Pascual Bailon; <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony of Padua in a <i>guing&oacute;n</i>
habit looking with tears upon a Christ Child dressed as a
Captain-General with the three-cornered hat, sword, and boots, as in
the children&rsquo;s ball at Madrid that character is
represented&mdash;which signified for Capitan Tiago that while God
might include in His omnipotence the power of a Captain-General of the
Philippines, the Franciscans would nevertheless play with Him as with a
doll. There, might also be seen a <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony the Abbot with a hog by his side, a hog
that for the worthy Capitan was as miraculous as the saint himself, for
which reason he never dared to refer to it as the <i>hog</i>, but as
the <i>creature of holy <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony</i>; a <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e1968" href="#xd24e1968" name="xd24e1968">40</a>]</span>of Assisi
in a coffee-colored robe and with seven wings, placed over a
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Vincent who had only two but in
compensation carried a trumpet; a <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Peter the Martyr with his head split open by
the talibon of an evil-doer and held fast by a kneeling infidel, side
by side with another <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Peter cutting
off the ear of a Moro, Malchus<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1980src"
href="#xd24e1980" name="xd24e1980src">3</a> no doubt, who was gnawing
his lips and writhing with pain, while a fighting-cock on a doric
column crowed and flapped his wings&mdash;from all of which Capitan
Tiago deduced that in order to be a saint it was just as well to smite
as to be smitten.</p>
<p class="par">Who could enumerate that army of images and recount the
virtues and perfections that were treasured there! A whole chapter
would hardly suffice. Yet we must not pass over in silence a beautiful
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Michael of painted and gilded wood
almost four feet high. The Archangel is biting his lower lip and with
flashing eyes, frowning forehead, and rosy cheeks is grasping a Greek
shield and brandishing in his right hand a Sulu kris, ready, as would
appear from his attitude and expression, to smite a worshiper or any
one else who might approach, rather than the horned and tailed devil
that had his teeth set in his girlish leg.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago never went near this image from fear of a
miracle. Had not other images, even those more rudely carved ones that
issue from the carpenter shops of Paete,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1990src" href="#xd24e1990" name="xd24e1990src">4</a> many times
come to life for the confusion and punishment of incredulous sinners?
It is a well-known fact that a certain image of Christ in Spain, when
invoked as a witness of promises of love, had assented with a movement
of the head in the presence of the judge, and that another such image
had reached out its right arm to embrace <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Lutgarda. And furthermore, had he not himself
read a booklet recently published about a mimic sermon preached
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e1996" href="#xd24e1996" name=
"xd24e1996">41</a>]</span>by an image of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Dominic in Soriano? True, the saint had not
said a single word, but from his movements it was inferred, at any rate
the author of the booklet inferred, that he was announcing the end of
the world.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2001src" href="#xd24e2001" name=
"xd24e2001src">5</a> Was it not reported, too, that the Virgin of Luta
in the town of Lipa had one cheek swollen larger than the other and
that there was mud on the borders of her gown? Does not this prove
mathematically that the holy images also walk about without holding up
their skirts and that they even suffer from the toothache, perhaps for
our sake? Had he not seen with his own eyes, during the regular
Good-Friday sermon, all the images of Christ move and bow their heads
thrice in unison, thereby calling forth wails and cries from the women
and other sensitive souls destined for Heaven? More? We ourselves have
seen the preacher show to the congregation at the moment of the descent
from the cross a handkerchief stained with blood, and were ourselves on
the point of weeping piously, when, to the sorrow of our soul, a
sacristan assured us that it was all a joke, that the blood was that of
a chicken which had been roasted and eaten on the spot in spite of the
fact that it was Good Friday&mdash;and the sacristan was fat! So
Capitan Tiago, even though he was a prudent and pious individual, took
care not to approach the kris of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Michael. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take no
chances,&rdquo; he would say to himself, &ldquo;I know that he&rsquo;s
an archangel, but I don&rsquo;t trust him, no, I don&rsquo;t trust
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Not a year passed without his joining with an orchestra
in the pilgrimage to the wealthy shrine of Antipolo. He paid for two
thanksgiving masses of the many that make up the three novenas, and
also for the days when there are no novenas, and washed himself
afterwards in the famous <i>b&aacute;tis</i>, or pool, where the sacred
Image herself had bathed. Her votaries can even yet discern the tracks
of her feet and the traces of her locks in the hard rock, where she
dried them, resembling exactly those made by any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2017" href="#xd24e2017" name=
"xd24e2017">42</a>]</span>woman who uses coconut-oil, and just as if
her hair had been steel or diamonds and she had weighed a thousand
tons. We should like to see the terrible Image once shake her sacred
hair in the eyes of those credulous persons and put her foot upon their
tongues or their heads. There at the very edge of the pool Capitan
Tiago made it his duty to eat roast pig, <i>sinigang</i> of
<i>dalag</i> with <i>alibambang</i> leaves, and other more or less
appetizing dishes. The two masses would cost him over four hundred
pesos, but it was cheap, after all, if one considered the glory that
the Mother of the Lord would acquire from the pin-wheels, rockets,
bombs, and mortars, and also the increased profits which, thanks to
these masses, would come to one during the year.</p>
<p class="par">But Antipolo was not the only theater of his
ostentatious devotion. In Binondo, in Pampanga, and in the town of San
Diego, when he was about to put up a fighting-cock with large wagers,
he would send gold moneys to the curate for propitiatory masses and,
just as the Romans consulted the augurs before a battle, giving food to
the sacred fowls, so Capitan Tiago would also consult his augurs, with
the modifications befitting the times and the new truths, tie would
watch closely the flame of the tapers, the smoke from the incense, the
voice of the priest, and from it all attempt to forecast his luck. It
was an admitted fact that he lost very few wagers, and in those cases
it was due to the unlucky circumstance that the officiating priest was
hoarse, or that the altar-candles were few or contained too much
tallow, or that a bad piece of money had slipped in with the rest. The
warden of the Brotherhood would then assure him that such reverses were
tests to which he was subjected by Heaven to receive assurance of his
fidelity and devotion. So, beloved by the priests, respected by the
sacristans, humored by the Chinese chandlers and the dealers in
fireworks, he was a man happy in the religion of this world, and
persons of discernment and great piety even claimed for him great
influence in the celestial court.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2031" href=
"#xd24e2031" name="xd24e2031">43</a>]</span>That he was at peace with
the government cannot be doubted, however difficult an achievement it
may seem. Incapable of any new idea and satisfied with his <i>modus
vivendi</i>, he was ever ready to gratify the desires of the last
official of the fifth class in every one of the offices, to make
presents of hams, capons, turkeys, and Chinese fruits at all seasons of
the year. If he heard any one speak ill of the natives, he, who did not
consider himself as such, would join in the chorus and speak worse of
them; if any one aspersed the Chinese or Spanish mestizos, he would do
the same, perhaps because he considered himself become a full-blooded
Iberian. He was ever first to talk in favor of any new imposition of
taxes, or special assessment, especially when he smelled a contract or
a farming assignment behind it. He always had an orchestra ready for
congratulating and serenading the governors, judges, and other
officials on their name-days and birthdays, at the birth or death of a
relative, and in fact at every variation from the usual monotony. For
such occasions he would secure laudatory poems and hymns in which were
celebrated &ldquo;the kind and loving governor,&rdquo; &ldquo;the brave
and courageous judge for whom there awaits in heaven the palm of the
just,&rdquo; with many other things of the same kind.</p>
<p class="par">He was the president of the rich guild of mestizos in
spite of the protests of many of them, who did not regard him as one of
themselves. In the two years that he held this office he wore out ten
frock coats, an equal number of high hats, and half a dozen canes. The
frock coat and the high hat were in evidence at the Ayuntamiento, in
the governor-general&rsquo;s palace, and at military headquarters; the
high hat and the frock coat might have been noticed in the cockpit, in
the market, in the processions, in the Chinese shops, and under the hat
and within the coat might have been seen the perspiring Capitan Tiago,
waving his tasseled cane, directing, arranging, and throwing everything
into disorder with marvelous activity and a gravity even more
marvelous.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2039" href=
"#xd24e2039" name="xd24e2039">44</a>]</span>So the authorities saw in
him a safe man, gifted with the best of dispositions, peaceful,
tractable, and obsequious, who read no books or newspapers from Spain,
although he spoke Spanish well. Indeed, they rather looked upon him
with the feeling with which a poor student contemplates the worn-out
heel of his old shoe, twisted by his manner of walking. In his case
there was truth in both the Christian and profane proverbs <i lang=
"la">beati pauperes spiritu</i> and <i lang="la">beati
possidentes</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2047src" href="#xd24e2047"
name="xd24e2047src">6</a> and there might well be applied to him that
translation, according to some people incorrect, from the Greek,
&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest and peace to men of good-will on
earth!&rdquo; even though we shall see further along that it is not
sufficient for men to have good-will in order to live in peace.</p>
<p class="par">The irreverent considered him a fool, the poor regarded
him as a heartless and cruel exploiter of misery and want, and his
inferiors saw in him a despot and a tyrant. As to the women, ah, the
women! Accusing rumors buzzed through the wretched nipa huts, and it
was said that wails and sobs might be heard mingled with the weak cries
of an infant. More than one young woman was pointed out by her
neighbors with the finger of scorn: she had a downcast glance and a
faded cheek. But such things never robbed him of sleep nor did any
maiden disturb his peace. It was an old woman who made him suffer, an
old woman who was his rival in piety and who had gained from many
curates such enthusiastic praises and eulogies as he in his best days
had never received.</p>
<p class="par">Between Capitan Tiago and this widow, who had inherited
from brothers and cousins, there existed a holy rivalry which redounded
to the benefit of the Church as the competition among the Pampanga
steamers then redounded to the benefit of the public. Did Capitan Tiago
present to some Virgin a silver wand ornamented with emeralds and
topazes? At once Do&ntilde;a Patrocinio had ordered another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2054" href="#xd24e2054" name=
"xd24e2054">45</a>]</span>of gold set with diamonds! If at the time of
the Naval procession<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2056src" href=
"#xd24e2056" name="xd24e2056src">7</a> Capitan Tiago erected an arch
with two fa&ccedil;ades, covered with ruffled cloth and decorated with
mirrors, glass globes, and chandeliers, then Do&ntilde;a Patrocinio
would have another with four facades, six feet higher, and more
gorgeous hangings. Then he would fall back on his reserves, his strong
point, his specialty&mdash;masses with bombs and fireworks; whereat
Do&ntilde;a Patrocinia could only gnaw at her lips with her toothless
gums, because, being exceedingly nervous, she could not endure the
chiming of the bells and still less the explosions of the bombs. While
he smiled in triumph, she would plan her revenge and pay the money of
others to secure the best orators of the five Orders in Manila, the
most famous preachers of the Cathedral, and even the Paulists,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2068src" href="#xd24e2068" name="xd24e2068src">8</a>
to preach on the holy days upon profound theological subjects to the
sinners who understood only the vernacular of the mariners. The
partizans of Capitan Tiago would observe that she slept during the
sermon; but her adherents would answer that the sermon was paid for in
advance, and by her, and that in any affair payment was the prime
requisite. At length, she had driven him from the field completely by
presenting to the church three <i>andas</i> of gilded silver, each one
of which cost her over three thousand pesos. Capitan Tiago hoped that
the old woman would breathe her last almost any day, or that she would
lose five or six of her lawsuits, so that he might be alone in serving
God; but unfortunately the best lawyers of the <i>Real Audiencia</i>
looked after her interests, and as to her health, there was no part of
her that could be attacked by sickness; she seemed to be a steel wire,
no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2081" href="#xd24e2081" name=
"xd24e2081">46</a>]</span>doubt for the edification of souls, and she
hung on in this vale of tears with the tenacity of a boil on the skin.
Her adherents were secure in the belief that she would be canonized at
her death and that Capitan Tiago himself would have to worship her at
the altars&mdash;all of which he agreed to and cheerfully promised,
provided only that she die soon.</p>
<p class="par">Such was Capitan Tiago in the days of which we write. As
for the past, he was the only son of a sugar-planter of Malabon,
wealthy enough, but so miserly that he would not spend a cent to
educate his son, for which reason the little Santiago had been the
servant of a good Dominican, a worthy man who had tried to train him in
all of good that he knew and could teach. When he had reached the happy
stage of being known among his acquaintances as a <i>logician</i>, that
is, when he began to study logic, the death of his protector, soon
followed by that of his father, put an end to his studies and he had to
turn his attention to business affairs. He married a pretty young woman
of Santa Cruz, who gave him social position and helped him to make his
fortune. Do&ntilde;a Pia Alba was not satisfied with buying and selling
sugar, indigo, and coffee, but wished to plant and reap, so the
newly-married couple bought land in San Diego. From this time dated
their friendship with Padre Damoso and with Don Rafael Ibarra, the
richest capitalist of the town.</p>
<p class="par">The lack of an heir in the first six years of their
wedded life made of that eagerness to accumulate riches almost a
censurable ambition. Do&ntilde;a Pia was comely, strong, and healthy,
yet it was in vain that she offered novenas and at the advice of the
devout women of San Diego made a pilgrimage to the Virgin of
Kaysaysay<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2090src" href="#xd24e2090" name=
"xd24e2090src">9</a> in Taal, distributed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e2115" href="#xd24e2115" name="xd24e2115">47</a>]</span>alms to
the poor, and danced at midday in May in the procession of the Virgin
of Turumba<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2117src" href="#xd24e2117" name=
"xd24e2117src">10</a> in Pakil. But it was all with no result until
Fray Damaso advised her to go to Obando to dance in the fiesta of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Pascual Bailon and ask him for a
son. Now it is well known that there is in Obando a trinity which
grants sons or daughters according to request&mdash;Our Lady of
Salambaw, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara, and <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Pascual. Thanks to this wise advice,
Do&ntilde;a Pia soon recognized the signs of approaching motherhood.
But alas! like the fisherman of whom Shakespeare tells in
<i>Macbeth</i>, who ceased to sing when he had found a treasure, she at
once lost all her mirthfulness, fell into melancholy, and was never
seen to smile again. &ldquo;Capriciousness, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2133" href="#xd24e2133" name=
"xd24e2133">48</a>]</span>natural in her condition,&rdquo; commented
all, even Capitan Tiago. A puerperal fever put an end to her hidden
grief, and she died, leaving behind a beautiful girl baby for whom Fray
Damaso himself stood sponsor. As <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Pascual had not granted the son that was asked,
they gave the child the name of Maria Clara, in honor of the Virgin of
Salambaw and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara, punishing the
worthy <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Pascual with silence.</p>
<p class="par">The little girl grew up under the care of her aunt
Isabel, that good old lady of monkish urbanity whom we met at the
beginning of the story. For the most part, her early life was spent in
San Diego, on account of its healthful climate, and there Padre Damaso
was devoted to her.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara had not the small eyes of her father; like
her mother, she had eyes large, black, long-lashed, merry and smiling
when she was playing but sad, deep, and pensive in moments of repose.
As a child her hair was curly and almost blond, her straight nose was
neither too pointed nor too flat, while her mouth with the merry
dimples at the corners recalled the small and pleasing one of her
mother, her skin had the fineness of an onion-cover and was white as
cotton, according to her perplexed relatives, who found the traces of
Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s paternity in her small and shapely ears. Aunt
Isabel ascribed her half-European features to the longings of
Do&ntilde;a Pia, whom she remembered to have seen many times weeping
before the image of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony.
Another cousin was of the same opinion, differing only in the choice of
the smut, as for her it was either the Virgin herself or <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Michael. A famous philosopher, who was the
cousin of Capitan Tinong and who had memorized the
&ldquo;Amat,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2154src" href=
"#xd24e2154" name="xd24e2154src">11</a> sought for the true explanation
in planetary influences.</p>
<p class="par">The idol of all, Maria Clara grew up amidst smiles and
love. The very friars showered her with attentions when she appeared in
the processions dressed in white, her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e2160" href="#xd24e2160" name="xd24e2160">49</a>]</span>abundant
hair interwoven with tuberoses and sampaguitas, with two diminutive
wings of silver and gold fastened on the back of her gown, and carrying
in her hands a pair of white doves tied with blue ribbons. Afterwards,
she would be so merry and talk so sweetly in her childish simplicity
that the enraptured Capitan Tiago could do nothing but bless the saints
of Obando and advise every one to purchase beautiful works of
sculpture.</p>
<p class="par">In southern countries the girl of thirteen or fourteen
years changes into a woman as the bud of the night becomes a flower in
the morning. At this period of change, so full of mystery and romance,
Maria Clara was placed, by the advice of the curate of Binondo, in the
nunnery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Catherine<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2167src" href="#xd24e2167" name=
"xd24e2167src">12</a> in order to receive strict religious training
from the Sisters. With tears she took leave of Padre Damaso and of the
only lad who had been a friend of her childhood, Crisostomo Ibarra, who
himself shortly afterward went away to Europe. There in that convent,
which communicates with the world through double bars, even under the
watchful eyes of the nuns, she spent seven years.</p>
<p class="par">Each having his own particular ends in view and knowing
the mutual inclinations of the two young persons, Don Rafael and
Capitan Tiago agreed upon the marriage of their children and the
formation of a business partnership. This agreement, which was
concluded some years after the younger Ibarra&rsquo;s departure, was
celebrated with equal joy by two hearts in widely separated parts of
the world and under very different circumstances. <span class=

celebrated Lady was first brought from Acapulco, Mexico, by Juan

By reason of her miraculous powers of allaying the storms she was
carried back and forth in the state galleons on a number of voyages,
until in 1672 she was formally installed in a church in the hills
northeast of Manila, under the care of the Augustinian Fathers. While
her shrine was building she is said to have appeared to the faithful in
the top of a large breadfruit tree, which is known to the Tagalogs as

<h2 class="main">An Idyl on an Azotea</h2>
<div class="epigraph">
<p class="par first">The Song of Songs, which is Solomon&rsquo;s.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That morning Aunt Isabel and Maria Clara went
early to mass, the latter elegantly dressed and wearing a rosary of
blue beads, which partly served as a bracelet for her, and the former
with her spectacles in order to read her <i>Anchor of Salvation</i>
during the holy communion. Scarcely had the priest disappeared from the
altar when the maiden expressed a desire for returning home, to the
great surprise and displeasure of her good aunt, who believed her niece
to be as pious and devoted to praying as a nun, at least. Grumbling and
crossing herself, the good old lady rose. &ldquo;The good Lord will
forgive me, Aunt Isabel, since He must know the hearts of girls better
than you do,&rdquo; Maria Clara might have said to check the severe yet
maternal chidings.</p>
<p class="par">After they had breakfasted, Maria Clara consumed her
impatience in working at a silk purse while her aunt was trying to
clean up the traces of the former night&rsquo;s revelry by swinging a
feather duster about. Capitan Tiago was busy looking over some papers.
Every noise in the street, every carriage that passed, caused the
maiden to tremble and quickened the beatings of her heart. Now she
wished that she were back in the quiet convent among her friends; there
she could have seen him without emotion and agitation! But was he not
the companion of her infancy, had they not played together and even
quarreled at times? The reason for all this I need not explain; if you,
O reader, have ever loved, you will understand; and if you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2191" href="#xd24e2191" name=
"xd24e2191">51</a>]</span>have not, it is useless for me to tell you,
as the uninitiated do not comprehend these mysteries.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe, Maria, that the doctor is
right,&rdquo; said Capitan Tiago. &ldquo;You ought to go into the
country, for you are pale and need fresh air. What do you think of
Malabon or San Diego?&rdquo; At the mention of the latter place Maria
Clara blushed like a poppy and was unable to answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You and Isabel can go at once to the convent to
get your clothes and to say good-by to your friends,&rdquo; he
continued, without raising his head. &ldquo;You will not stay there any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl felt the vague sadness that possesses the mind
when we leave forever a place where we have been happy, but another
thought softened this sorrow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In four or five days, after you get some new
clothes made, we&rsquo;ll go to Malabon. Your godfather is no longer in
San Diego. The priest that you may have noticed here last night, that
young padre, is the new curate whom we have there, and he is a
saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think that San Diego would be better,
cousin,&rdquo; observed Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;Besides, our house there is
better and the time for the fiesta draws near.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara wanted to embrace her aunt for this speech,
but hearing a carriage stop, she turned pale.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, very true,&rdquo; answered Capitan Tiago, and
then in a different tone he exclaimed, &ldquo;Don
Crisostomo!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The maiden let her sewing fall from her hands and wished
to move but could not&mdash;a violent tremor ran through her body.
Steps were heard on the stairway and then a fresh, manly voice. As if
that voice had some magic power, the maiden controlled her emotion and
ran to hide in the oratory among the saints. The two cousins laughed,
and Ibarra even heard the noise of the door closing. Pale and breathing
rapidly, the maiden pressed her beating heart and tried to listen. She
heard his voice, that beloved voice that for so long a time she had
heard only in her dreams he was asking for her! Overcome with joy, she
kissed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2210" href="#xd24e2210" name=
"xd24e2210">52</a>]</span>the nearest saint, which happened to be
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony the Abbot, a saint happy in
flesh and in wood, ever the object of pleasing temptations! Afterwards
she sought the keyhole in order to see and examine him. She smiled, and
when her aunt snatched her from that position she unconsciously threw
her arms around the old lady&rsquo;s neck and rained kisses upon
her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Foolish child, what&rsquo;s the matter with
you?&rdquo; the old lady was at last able to say as she wiped a tear
from her faded eyes. Maria Clara felt ashamed and covered her eyes with
her plump arm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come on, get ready, come!&rdquo; added the old
aunt fondly. &ldquo;While he is talking to your father about you. Come,
don&rsquo;t make him wait.&rdquo; Like a child the maiden obediently
followed her and they shut themselves up in her chamber.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago and Ibarra were conversing in a lively
manner when Aunt Isabel appeared half dragging her niece, who was
looking in every direction except toward the persons in the room.</p>
<p class="par">What said those two souls communicating through the
language of the eyes, more perfect than that of the lips, the language
given to the soul in order that sound may not mar the ecstasy of
feeling? In such moments, when the thoughts of two happy beings
penetrate into each other&rsquo;s souls through the eyes, the spoken
word is halting, rude, and weak&mdash;it is as the harsh, slow roar of
the thunder compared with the rapidity of the dazzling lightning flash,
expressing feelings already recognized, ideas already understood, and
if words are made use of it is only because the heart&rsquo;s desire,
dominating all the being and flooding it with happiness, wills that the
whole human organism with all its physical and psychical powers give
expression to the song of joy that rolls through the soul. To the
questioning glance of love, as it flashes out and then conceals itself,
speech has no reply; the smile, the kiss, the sigh answer.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2224" href=
"#xd24e2224" name="xd24e2224">53</a>]</span>Soon the two lovers,
fleeing from the dust raised by Aunt Isabel&rsquo;s broom, found
themselves on the azotea where they could commune in liberty among the
little arbors. What did they tell each other in murmurs that you nod
your heads, O little red cypress flowers? Tell it, you who have
fragrance in your breath and color on your lips. And thou, O zephyr,
who learnest rare harmonies in the stillness of the dark night amid the
hidden depths of our virgin forests! Tell it, O sunbeams, brilliant
manifestation upon earth of the Eternal, sole immaterial essence in a
material world, you tell it, for I only know how to relate prosaic
commonplaces. But since you seem unwilling to do so, I am going to try
myself.</p>
<p class="par">The sky was blue and a fresh breeze, not yet laden with
the fragrance of roses, stirred the leaves and flowers of the vines;
that is why the cypresses, the orchids, the dried fishes, and the
Chinese lanterns were trembling. The splash of paddles in the muddy
waters of the river and the rattle of carriages and carts passing over
the Binondo bridge came up to them distinctly, although they did not
hear what the old aunt murmured as she saw where they were:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, there you&rsquo;ll be watched by the whole
neighborhood.&rdquo; At first they talked nonsense, giving utterance
only to those sweet inanities which are so much like the boastings of
the nations of Europe&mdash;pleasing and honey-sweet at home, but
causing foreigners to laugh or frown.</p>
<p class="par">She, like a sister of Cain, was of course jealous and
asked her sweetheart, &ldquo;Have you always thought of me? Have you
never forgotten me on all your travels in the great cities among so
many beautiful women?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He, too, was a brother of Cain, and sought to evade such
questions, making use of a little fiction. &ldquo;Could I forget
you?&rdquo; he answered as he gazed enraptured into her dark eyes.
&ldquo;Could I be faithless to my oath, my sacred oath? Do you remember
that stormy night when you saw me weeping alone by the side of my dead
mother and, drawing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2232" href=
"#xd24e2232" name="xd24e2232">54</a>]</span>near to me, you put your
hand on my shoulder, that hand which for so long a time you had not
allowed me to touch, saying to me, &lsquo;You have lost your mother
while I never had one,&rsquo; and you wept with me? You loved her and
she looked upon you as a daughter. Outside it rained and the lightning
flashed, but within I seemed to hear music and to see a smile on the
pallid face of the dead. Oh, that my parents were alive and might
behold you now! I then caught your hand along with the hand of my
mother and swore to love you and to make you happy, whatever fortune
Heaven might have in store for me; and that oath, which has never
weighed upon me as a burden, I now renew!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Could I forget you? The thought of you has ever
been with me, strengthening me amid the dangers of travel, and has been
a comfort to my soul&rsquo;s loneliness in foreign lands. The thoughts
of you have neutralized the lotus-effect of Europe, which erases from
the memories of so many of our countrymen the hopes and misfortunes of
our fatherland. In dreams I saw you standing on the shore at Manila,
gazing at the far horizon wrapped in the warm light of the early dawn.
I heard the slow, sad song that awoke in me sleeping affections and
called back to the memory of my heart the first years of our childhood,
our joys, our pleasures, and all that happy past which you gave life to
while you were in our town. It seemed to me that you were the fairy,
the spirit, the poetic incarnation of my fatherland, beautiful,
unaffected, lovable, frank, a true daughter of the Philippines, that
beautiful land which unites with the imposing virtues of the mother
country, Spain, the admirable qualities of a young people, as you unite
in your being all that is beautiful and lovely, the inheritance of both
races&rdquo; so indeed the love of you and that of my fatherland have
become fused into one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Could I forget you? Many times have I thought
that I heard the sound of your piano and the accents of your voice.
When in Germany, as I wandered at twilight <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2239" href="#xd24e2239" name=
"xd24e2239">55</a>]</span>in the woods, peopled with the fantastic
creations of its poets and the mysterious legends of past generations,
always I called upon your name, imagining that I saw you in the mists
that rose from the depths of the valley, or I fancied that I heard your
voice in the rustling of the leaves. When from afar I heard the songs
of the peasants as they returned from their labors, it seemed to me
that their tones harmonized with my inner voices, that they were
singing for <i>you</i>, and thus they lent reality to my illusions and
dreams. At times I became lost among the mountain paths and while the
night descended slowly, as it does there, I would find myself still
wandering, seeking my way among the pines and beeches and oaks. Then
when some scattering rays of moonlight slipped down into the clear
spaces left in the dense foliage, I seemed to see you in the heart of
the forest as a dim, loving shade wavering about between the spots of
light and shadow. If perhaps the nightingale poured forth his varied
trills, I fancied it was because he saw you and was inspired by
you.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have I thought of you? The fever of love not only
gave warmth to the snows but colored the ice! The beautiful skies of
Italy with their clear depths reminded me of your eyes, its sunny
landscape spoke to me of your smile; the plains of Andalusia with their
scent-laden airs, peopled with oriental memories, full of romance and
color, told me of your love! On dreamy, moonlit nights, while boating
oil the Rhine, I have asked myself if my fancy did not deceive me as I
saw you among the poplars on the banks, on the rocks of the Lorelei, or
in the midst of the waters, singing in the silence of the night as if
you were a comforting fairy maiden sent to enliven the solitude and
sadness of those ruined castles!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have not traveled like you, so I know only your
town and Manila and Antipolo,&rdquo; she answered with a smile which
showed that she believed all he said. &ldquo;But since I said good-by
to you and entered the convent, I have always thought of you and have
only put you out of my mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2248"
href="#xd24e2248" name="xd24e2248">56</a>]</span>when ordered to do so
by my confessor, who imposed many penances upon me. I recalled our
games and our quarrels when we were children. You used to pick up the
most beautiful shells and search in the river for the roundest and
smoothest pebbles of different colors that we might play games with
them. You were very stupid and always lost, and by way of a forfeit I
would slap you with the palm of my hand, but I always tried not to
strike you hard, for I had pity on you. In those games you cheated
much, even more than I did, and we used to finish our play in a
quarrel. Do you remember that time when you became really angry at me?
Then you made me suffer, but afterwards, when I thought of it in the
convent, I smiled and longed for you so that we might quarrel
again&mdash;so that we might once more make up. We were still children
and had gone with your mother to bathe in the brook under the shade of
the thick bamboo. On the banks grew many flowers and plants whose
strange names you told me in Latin and Spanish, for you were even then
studying in the Ateneo.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2250src" href=
"#xd24e2250" name="xd24e2250src">1</a> I paid no attention, but amused
myself by running after the needle-like dragon-flies and the
butterflies with their rainbow colors and tints of mother-of-pearl as
they swarmed about among the flowers. Sometimes I tried to surprise
them with my hands or to catch the little fishes that slipped rapidly
about amongst the moss and stones in the edge of the water. Once you
disappeared suddenly and when you returned you brought a crown of
leaves and orange blossoms, which you placed upon my head, calling me
Chloe. For yourself you made one of vines. But your mother snatched
away my crown, and after mashing it with a stone mixed it with the
<i>gogo</i> with which she was going to wash our heads. The tears came
into your eyes and you said that she did not understand mythology.
&lsquo;Silly boy,&rsquo; your mother exclaimed, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2256" href="#xd24e2256" name=
"xd24e2256">57</a>]</span>see how sweet your hair will smell
afterwards.&rsquo; I laughed, but you were offended and would not talk
with me, and for the rest of the day appeared so serious that then I
wanted to cry. On our way back to the town through the hot sun, I
picked some sage leaves that grew beside the path and gave them to you
to put in your hat so that you might not get a headache. You smiled and
caught my hand, and we made up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra smiled with happiness as he opened his pocketbook
and took from it a piece of paper in which were wrapped some dry,
blackened leaves which gave off a sweet odor. &ldquo;Your sage
leaves,&rdquo; he said, in answer to her inquiring look. &ldquo;This is
all that you have ever given me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She in turn snatched from her bosom a little pouch of
white satin. &ldquo;You must not touch this,&rdquo; she said, tapping
the palm of his hand lightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a letter of
farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The one I wrote to you before leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you ever written me any other,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And what did I say to you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Many fibs, excuses of a delinquent debtor,&rdquo;
she answered smilingly, thus giving him to understand how sweet to her
those fibs were. &ldquo;Be quiet now and I&rsquo;ll read it to you.
I&rsquo;ll leave out your fine phrases in order not to make a martyr of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Raising the paper to the height of her eyes so that the
youth might not see her face, she began:
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>My</i>&rsquo;&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll not read what
follows that because it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her eyes ran along some lines.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;My father wishes me to go away, in spite
of all my pleadings. &lsquo;You are a man now,&rsquo; he told me,
&lsquo;and you must think about your future and about your duties. You
must learn the science of life, a thing which your fatherland cannot
teach you, so that you may some day be useful to it. If you remain here
in my shadow, in this environment of business affairs, you will not
learn to look far ahead. The day in which you lose me you will find
yourself like the plant of which our poet Baltazar tells: grown in the
water, its leaves wither at the least scarcity of moisture <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2280" href="#xd24e2280" name=
"xd24e2280">58</a>]</span>and a moment&rsquo;s heat dries it up.
Don&rsquo;t you understand? You are almost a young man, and yet you
weep!&rsquo; These reproaches hurt me and I confessed that I loved you.
My father reflected for a time in silence and then, placing his hand on
my shoulder, said in a trembling voice, &lsquo;Do you think that you
alone know how to love, that your father does not love you, and that he
will not feel the separation from you? It is only a short time since we
lost your mother, and I must journey on alone toward old age, toward
the very time of life when I would seek help and comfort from your
youth, yet I accept my loneliness, hardly knowing whether I shall ever
see you again. But you must think of other and greater things; the
future lies open before you, while for me it is already passing behind;
your love is just awakening, while mine is dying; fire burns in your
blood, while the chill is creeping into mine. Yet you weep and cannot
sacrifice the present for the future, useful as it may be alike to
yourself and to your country.&rsquo; My father&rsquo;s eyes filled with
tears and I fell upon my knees at his feet, I embraced him, I begged
his forgiveness, and I assured him that I was ready to set
out&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra&rsquo;s growing agitation caused her to suspend
the reading, for he had grown pale and was pacing back and forth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What is troubling
you?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have almost made me forget that I have my
duties, that I must leave at once for the town. Tomorrow is the day for
commemorating the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara silently fixed her large dreamy eyes upon
him for a few moments and then, picking some flowers, she said with
emotion, &ldquo;Go, I won&rsquo;t detain you longer! In a few days we
shall see each other again. Lay these flowers on the tomb of your
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A few moments later the youth descended the stairway
accompanied by Capitan Tiago and Aunt Isabel, while Maria Clara shut
herself up in the oratory.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Please tell Andeng to get the house ready, as
Maria and Isabel are coming. A pleasant journey!&rdquo; said Capitan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2294" href="#xd24e2294" name=
"xd24e2294">59</a>]</span>Tiago as Ibarra stepped into the carriage,
which at once started in the direction of the plaza of San Gabriel.</p>
<p class="par">Afterwards, by way of consolation, her father said to
Maria Clara, who was weeping beside an image of the Virgin,
&ldquo;Come, light two candles worth two reals each, one to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Roch,<a class="noteref" id=

<h2 class="label">Chapter VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Recollections</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ibarra&rsquo;s carriage was passing through a part
of the busiest district in Manila, the same which the night before had
made him feel sad, but which by daylight caused him to smile in spite
of himself. The movement in every part, so many carriages coming and
going at full speed, the carromatas and calesas, the Europeans, the
Chinese, the natives, each in his own peculiar costume, the
fruit-venders, the money-changers, the naked porters, the grocery
stores, the lunch stands and restaurants, the shops, and even the carts
drawn by the impassive and indifferent carabao, who seems to amuse
himself in carrying burdens while he patiently ruminates, all this
noise and confusion, the very sun itself, the distinctive odors and the
motley colors, awoke in the youth&rsquo;s mind a world of sleeping
recollections.</p>
<p class="par">Those streets had not yet been paved, and two successive
days of sunshine filled them with dust which covered everything and
made the passer-by cough while it nearly blinded him. A day of rain
formed pools of muddy water, which at night reflected the carriage
lights and splashed mud a distance of several yards away upon the
pedestrians on the narrow sidewalks. And how many women have left their
embroidered slippers in those waves of mud!</p>
<p class="par">Then there might have been seen repairing those streets
the lines of convicts with their shaven heads, dressed in short-sleeved
camisas and pantaloons that reached only to their knees, each with his
letter and number in blue. On their legs were chains partly wrapped in
dirty rags to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2319" href=
"#xd24e2319" name="xd24e2319">61</a>]</span>ease the chafing or perhaps
the chill of the iron. Joined two by two, scorched in the sun, worn out
by the heat and fatigue, they were lashed and goaded by a whip in the
hands of one of their own number, who perhaps consoled himself with
this power of maltreating others. They were tall men with somber faces,
which he had never seen brightened with the light of a smile. Yet their
eyes gleamed when the whistling lash fell upon their shoulders or when
a passer-by threw them the chewed and broken stub of a cigar, which the
nearest would snatch up and hide in his salakot, while the rest
remained gazing at the passers-by with strange looks.</p>
<p class="par">The noise of the stones being crushed to fill the
puddles and the merry clank of the heavy fetters on the swollen ankles
seemed to remain with Ibarra. He shuddered as he recalled a scene that
had made a deep impression on his childish imagination. It was a hot
afternoon, and the burning rays of the sun fell perpendicularly upon a
large cart by the side of which was stretched out one of those
unfortunates, lifeless, yet with his eyes half opened. Two others were
silently preparing a bamboo bier, showing no signs of anger or sorrow
or impatience, for such is the character attributed to the natives:
today it is you, tomorrow it will be I, they say to themselves. The
people moved rapidly about without giving heed, women came up and after
a look of curiosity continued unconcerned on their way&mdash;it was
such a common sight that their hearts had become callous. Carriages
passed, flashing back from their varnished sides the rays of the sun
that burned in a cloudless sky. Only he, a child of eleven years and
fresh from the country, was moved, and to him alone it brought bad
dreams on the following night.</p>
<p class="par">There no longer existed the useful and honored <i>Puente
de Barcas</i>, the good Filipino pontoon bridge that had done its best
to be of service in spite of its natural imperfections and its rising
and falling at the caprice of the Pasig, which had more than once
abused it and finally destroyed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e2328" href="#xd24e2328" name="xd24e2328">62</a>]</span>it. The
almond trees in the plaza of San Gabriel<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2330src" href="#xd24e2330" name="xd24e2330src">1</a> had not
grown; they were still in the same feeble and stunted condition. The
Escolta appeared less beautiful in spite of the fact that an imposing
building with caryatids carved on its front now occupied the place of
the old row of shops. The new Bridge of Spain caught his attention,
while the houses on the right bank of the river among the clumps of
bamboo and trees where the Escolta ends and the Isla de Romero begins,
reminded him of the cool mornings when he used to pass there in a boat
on his way to the baths of Uli-Uli.</p>
<p class="par">He met many carriages, drawn by beautiful pairs of
dwarfish ponies, within which were government clerks who seemed yet
half asleep as they made their way to their offices, or military
officers, or Chinese in foolish and ridiculous attitudes, or Gave
friars and canons. In an elegant victoria he thought he recognized
Padre Damaso, grave and frowning, but he had already passed. Now he was
pleasantly greeted by Capitan Tinong, who was passing in a carretela
with his wife and two daughters.</p>
<p class="par">As they went down off the bridge the horses broke into a
trot along the Sabana Drive.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2337src" href=
"#xd24e2337" name="xd24e2337src">2</a> On the left the Arroceros Cigar
Factory resounded with the noise of the cigar-makers pounding the
tobacco leaves, and Ibarra was unable to restrain a smile as he thought
of the strong odor which about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon used
to float all over the <i>Puente de Barcas</i> and which had made him
sick when he was a child. The lively conversations and the repartee of
the crowds from the cigar factories carried him back to the district of
Lavapi&eacute;s in Madrid, with its riots of cigar-makers, so fatal for
the unfortunate policemen.</p>
<p class="par">The Botanical Garden drove away these agreeable
recollections; the demon of comparison brought before his mind the
Botanical Gardens of Europe, in countries where great, labor and much
money are needed to make a single <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e2348" href="#xd24e2348" name="xd24e2348">63</a>]</span>leaf grow
or one flower open its calyx; he recalled those of the colonies, where
they are well supplied and tended, and all open to the public. Ibarra
turned away his gaze toward the old Manila surrounded still by its
walls and moats like a sickly girl wrapped in the garments of her
grandmother&rsquo;s better days.</p>
<p class="par">Then the sight of the sea losing itself in the distance!
&ldquo;On the other shore lies Europe,&rdquo; thought the young
man,&mdash;&ldquo;Europe, with its attractive peoples in constant
movement in the search for happiness, weaving their dreams in the
morning and disillusioning themselves at the setting of the sun, happy
even in the midst of their calamities. Yes, on the farther shore of the
boundless sea are the really spiritual nations, those who, even though
they put no restraints on material development, are still more
spiritual than those who pride themselves on adoring only the
spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But these musings were in turn banished from his mind as
he came in sight of the little mound in Bagumbayan Field.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e2355src" href="#xd24e2355" name="xd24e2355src">3</a>
This isolated knoll at the side of the Luneta now caught his attention
and made him reminiscent. He thought of the man who had awakened his
intellect and made him understand goodness and justice. The ideas which
that man had impressed upon him were not many, to be sure, but they
were not meaningless repetitions, they were convictions which had not
paled in the light of the most brilliant foci of progress. That man was
an old priest whose words of farewell still resounded in his ears:
&ldquo;Do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2367" href="#xd24e2367"
name="xd24e2367">64</a>]</span>not forget that if knowledge is the
heritage of mankind, it is only the courageous who inherit it,&rdquo;
he had reminded him. &ldquo;I have tried to pass on to you what I got
from my teachers, the sum of which I have endeavored to increase and
transmit to the coming generation as far as in me lay. You will now do
the same for those who come after you, and you can treble it, since you
are going to rich countries.&rdquo; Then he had added with a smile,
&ldquo;They come here seeking wealth, go you to their country to seek
also that other wealth which we lack! But remember that all that
glitters is not gold.&rdquo; The old man had died on that spot.</p>
<p class="par">At these recollections the youth murmured audibly:
&ldquo;No, in spite of everything, the fatherland first, first the
Philippines, the child of Spain, first the Spanish fatherland! No, that
which is decreed by fate does not tarnish the honor of the fatherland,
no!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He gave little heed to Ermita, the phenix of nipa that
had rearisen from its ashes under the form of blue and white houses
with red-painted roofs of corrugated iron. Nor was his attention caught
by Malate, neither by the cavalry barracks with the spreading trees in
front, nor by the inhabitants or their little nipa huts, pyramidal or
prismatic in shape, hidden away among the banana plants and areca
palms, constructed like nests by each father of a family.</p>
<p class="par">The carriage continued on its way, meeting now and then
carromatas drawn by one or two ponies whose abaka harness indicated
that they were from the country. The drivers would try to catch a
glimpse of the occupant of the fine carriage, but would pass on without
exchanging a word, without a single salute. At times a heavy cart drawn
by a slow and indifferent carabao would appear on the dusty road over
which beat the brilliant sunlight of the tropics. The mournful and
monotonous song of the driver mounted on the back of the carabao would
be mingled at one time with the screechings of a dry wheel on the huge
axle of the heavy vehicle or at another time with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2375" href="#xd24e2375" name=
"xd24e2375">65</a>]</span>the dull scraping of worn-out runners on a
sledge which was dragged heavily through the dust, and over the ruts in
the road. In the fields and wide meadows the herds were grazing,
attended ever by the white buffalo-birds which roosted peacefully on
the backs of the animals while these chewed their cuds or browsed in
lazy contentment upon the rich grass. In the distance ponies frisked,
jumping and running about, pursued by the lively colts with long tails
and abundant manes who whinnied and pawed the ground with their hard
hoofs.</p>
<p class="par">Let us leave the youth dreaming or dozing, since neither
the sad nor the animated poetry of the open country held his attention.
For him there was no charm in the sun that gleamed upon the tops of the
trees and caused the rustics, with feet burned by the hot ground in
spite of their callousness, to hurry along, or that made the villager
pause beneath the shade of an almond tree or a bamboo brake while he
pondered upon vague and inexplicable things. While the youth&rsquo;s
carriage sways along like a drunken thing on account of the
inequalities in the surface of the road when passing over a bamboo
bridge or going up an incline or descending a steep slope, let us
return to Manila. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2379" href=

Field of Bagumbayan, adjoining the Luneta, was the place where
political prisoners were shot or garroted, and was the scene of the
author&rsquo;s execution on December 30, 1906. It is situated just
outside and east of the old Walled City (Manila proper), being the
location to which the natives who had occupied the site of Manila moved
their town after having been driven back by the Spaniards&mdash;hence
the name, which is a Tagalog compound meaning &ldquo;new town.&rdquo;
This place is now called Wallace Field, the name Bagumbayan being
applied to the driveway which was known to the Spaniards as the
<i>Paseo de las Aguadas</i>, or <i>de Vidal</i>, extending from the
Luneta to the Bridge of Spain, just outside the moat that, formerly
encircled the Walled City.&mdash;TR.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="par first">Ibarra had not been mistaken about the occupant of
the victoria, for it was indeed Padre Damaso, and he was on his way to
the house which the youth had just left.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the friar of
Maria Clara and Aunt Isabel, who were about to enter a silver-mounted
carriage. In the midst of his preoccupation Padre Damaso stroked the
maiden&rsquo;s cheek lightly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the convent to get my things,&rdquo; answered
the latter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ahaa! Aha! We&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s stronger,
we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; muttered the friar abstractedly, as with bowed
head and slow step he turned to the stairway, leaving the two women not
a little amazed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He must have a sermon to preach and is memorizing
it,&rdquo; commented Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;Get in, Maria, or we&rsquo;ll
be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Whether or not Padre Damaso was preparing a sermon we
cannot say, but it is certain that some grave matter filled his mind,
for he did not extend his hand to Capitan Tiago, who had almost to get
down on his knees to kiss it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Santiago,&rdquo; said the friar at once, &ldquo;I
have an important matter to talk to you about. Let&rsquo;s go into your
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago began to feel uneasy, so much so that he
did not know what to say; but he obeyed, following the heavy figure of
the priest, who closed the door behind him.</p>
<p class="par">While they confer in secret, let us learn what Fray
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2403" href="#xd24e2403" name=
"xd24e2403">67</a>]</span>Sibyla has been doing. The astute Dominican
is not at the rectory, for very soon after celebrating mass he had gone
to the convent of his order, situated just inside the gate of Isabel
II, or of Magellan, according to what family happened to be reigning in
Madrid. Without paying any attention to the rich odor of chocolate, or
to the rattle of boxes and coins which came from the treasury, and
scarcely acknowledging the respectful and deferential salute of the
procurator-brother, he entered, passed along several corridors, and
knocked at a door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; sighed a weak voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May God restore health to your Reverence,&rdquo;
was the young Dominican&rsquo;s greeting as he entered.</p>
<p class="par">Seated in a large armchair was an aged priest, wasted
and rather sallow, like the saints that Rivera painted. His eyes were
sunken in their hollow sockets, over which his heavy eyebrows were
almost always contracted, thus accentuating their brilliant gleam.
Padre Sibyla, with his arms crossed under the venerable scapulary of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Dominic, gazed at him feelingly,
then bowed his head and waited in silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed the old man, &ldquo;they advise
an operation, an operation, Hernando, at my age! This country, O this
terrible country! Take warning from my ease, Hernando!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Sibyla raised his eyes slowly and fixed them on the
sick man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What has your Reverence decided to
do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To die! Ah, what else can I do? I am suffering
too much, but&mdash;I have made many suffer, I am paying my debt! And
how are you? What has brought you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to talk about the business which
you committed to my care.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; answered the young man disgustedly,
as he seated himself and turned away his face with a contemptuous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2427" href="#xd24e2427" name=
"xd24e2427">68</a>]</span>expression, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been telling
us fairy tales. Young Ibarra is a youth of discernment; he
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a fool, but I believe that he is a good
lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You believe so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hostilities began last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Already? How?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Sibyla then recounted briefly what had taken place
between Padre Damaso and Ibarra. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he said in
conclusion, &ldquo;the young man is going to marry Capitan
Tiago&rsquo;s daughter, who was educated in the college of our
Sisterhood. He&rsquo;s rich, and won&rsquo;t care to make enemies and
to run the risk of ruining his fortune and his happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The sick man nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Yes, I think as
you do. With a wife like that and such a father-in-law, we&rsquo;ll own
him body and soul. If not, so much the better for him to declare
himself an enemy of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Sibyla looked at the old man in surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For the good of our holy Order, I mean, of
course,&rdquo; he added, breathing heavily. &ldquo;I prefer open
attacks to the silly praises and flatteries of friends, which are
really paid for.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does your Reverence think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man regarded him sadly. &ldquo;Keep it clearly
before you,&rdquo; he answered, gasping for breath. &ldquo;Our power
will last as long as it is believed in. If they attack us, the
government will say, &lsquo;They attack them because they see in them
an obstacle to their liberty, so then let us preserve
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But if it should listen to them? Sometimes the
government&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It will not listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nevertheless, if, led on by cupidity, it should
come to wish for itself what we are taking in&mdash;if there should be
some bold and daring one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then woe unto that one!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Both remained silent for a time, then the sick man
continued: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2459" href="#xd24e2459"
name="xd24e2459">69</a>]</span>&ldquo;Besides, we need their attacks,
to keep us awake; that makes us see our weaknesses so that we may
remedy them. Exaggerated flattery will deceive us and put us to sleep,
while outside our walls we shall be laughed at, and the day in which we
become an object of ridicule, we shall fall as we fell in Europe. Money
will not flow into our churches, no one will buy our scapularies or
girdles or anything else, and when we cease to be rich we shall no
longer be able to control consciences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we shall always have our estates, our
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All will be lost as we lost them in Europe! And
the worst of it is that we are working toward our own ruin. For
example, this unrestrained eagerness to raise arbitrarily the rents on
our lands each year, this eagerness which I have so vainly combated in
all the chapters, this will ruin us! The native sees himself obliged to
purchase farms in other places, which bring him as good returns as
ours, or better. I fear that we are already on the decline; <i>quos
vult perdere Jupiter dementat prius</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2468src" href="#xd24e2468" name="xd24e2468src">1</a> For this
reason we should not increase our burden; the people are already
murmuring. You have decided well: let us leave the others to settle
their accounts in that quarter; let us preserve the prestige that
remains to us, and as we shall soon appear before God, let us wash our
hands of it&mdash;and may the God of mercy have pity on our
weakness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So your Reverence thinks that the rent or
tax&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk any more about money,&rdquo;
interrupted the sick man with signs of disgust. &ldquo;You say that the
lieutenant threatened to Padre Damaso that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, Padre,&rdquo; broke in Fray Sibyla with a
faint smile, &ldquo;but this morning I saw him and he told me that he
was sorry for what occurred last night, that the sherry had gone to his
head, and that he believed that Padre Damaso was in the same condition.
&lsquo;And your threat?&rsquo; I asked him jokingly.
&lsquo;Padre,&rsquo; he answered me, &lsquo;I know how to keep my word
when my honor is affected, but I am not nor have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2477" href="#xd24e2477" name=
"xd24e2477">70</a>]</span>ever been an informer&mdash;for that reason I
wear only two stars.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After they had conversed a while longer on unimportant
subjects, Fray Sibyla took his departure.</p>
<p class="par">It was true that the lieutenant had not gone to the
Palace, but the Captain-General heard what had occurred. While talking
with some of his aides about the allusions that the Manila newspapers
were making to him under the names of comets and celestial apparitions,
one of them told him about the affair of Padre Damaso, with a somewhat
heightened coloring although substantially correct as to matter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From whom did you learn this?&rdquo; asked his
Excellency, smiling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From Laruja, who was telling it this morning in
the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Captain-General again smiled and said: &ldquo;A
woman or a friar can&rsquo;t insult one. I contemplate living in peace
for the time that I shall remain in this country and I don&rsquo;t want
any more quarrels with men who wear skirts. Besides, I&rsquo;ve learned
that the Provincial has scoffed at my orders. I asked for the removal
of this friar as a punishment and they transferred him to a better town
&lsquo;monkish tricks,&rsquo; as we say in Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But when his Excellency found himself alone he stopped
smiling. &ldquo;Ah, if this people were not so stupid, I would put a
curb on their Reverences,&rdquo; he sighed to himself. &ldquo;But every
people deserves its fate, so let&rsquo;s do as everybody else
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago, meanwhile, had concluded his interview
with Padre Damaso, or rather, to speak more exactly, Padre Damaso had
concluded with him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So now you are warned!&rdquo; said the Franciscan
on leaving. &ldquo;All this could have been avoided if you had
consulted me beforehand, if you had not lied when I asked you. Try not
to play any more foolish tricks, and trust your protector.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2497" href=
"#xd24e2497" name="xd24e2497">71</a>]</span>Capitan Tiago walked up and
down the sala a few times, meditating and sighing. Suddenly, as if a
happy thought had occurred to him, he ran to the oratory and
extinguished the candles and the lamp that had been lighted for
Ibarra&rsquo;s safety. &ldquo;The way is long and there&rsquo;s yet
time,&rdquo; he muttered. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2499"

<h2 class="main">The Town</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Almost on the margin of the lake, in the midst of
meadows and paddy-fields, lies the town of San Diego.<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2507src" href="#xd24e2507" name="xd24e2507src">1</a> From it
sugar, rice, coffee, and fruits are either exported or sold for a small
part of their value to the Chinese, who exploit the simplicity and
vices of the native farmers.</p>
<p class="par">When on a clear day the boys ascend to the upper part of
the church tower, which is beautified by moss and creeping plants, they
break out into joyful exclamations at the beauty of the scene spread
out before them. In the midst of the clustering roofs of nipa, tiles,
corrugated iron, and palm leaves, separated by groves and gardens, each
one is able to discover his own home, his little nest. Everything
serves as a mark: a tree, that tamarind with its light foliage, that
coco palm laden with nuts, like the Astarte Genetrix, or the Diana of
Ephesus with her numerous breasts, a bending bamboo, an areca palm, or
a cross. Yonder is the river, a huge glassy serpent sleeping on a green
carpet, with rocks, scattered here and there along its sandy channel,
that break its current into ripples. There, the bed is narrowed between
high banks to which the gnarled trees cling with bared roots; here, it
becomes a gentle slope where the stream widens and eddies about.
Farther away, a small hut built on the edge of the high bank seems to
defy the winds, the heights and the depths, presenting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2521" href="#xd24e2521" name=
"xd24e2521">73</a>]</span>with its slender posts the appearance of a
huge, long-legged bird watching for a reptile to seize upon. Trunks of
palm or other trees with their bark still on them unite the banks by a
shaky and infirm foot-bridge which, if not a very secure crossing, is
nevertheless a wonderful contrivance for gymnastic exercises in
preserving one&rsquo;s balance, a thing not to be despised. The boys
bathing in the river are amused by the difficulties of the old woman
crossing with a basket on her head or by the antics of the old man who
moves tremblingly and loses his staff in the water.</p>
<p class="par">But that which always attracts particular notice is what
might be called a peninsula of forest in the sea of cultivated fields.
There in that wood are century-old trees with hollow trunks, which die
only when their high tops are struck and set on fire by the
lightning&mdash;and it is said that the fire always checks itself and
dies out in the same spot. There are huge points of rock which time and
nature are clothing with velvet garments of moss. Layer after layer of
dust settles in the hollows, the rains beat it down, and the birds
bring seeds. The tropical vegetation spreads out luxuriantly in
thickets and underbrush, while curtains of interwoven vines hang from
the branches of the trees and twine about their roots or spread along
the ground, as if Flora were not yet satisfied but must place plant
above plant. Mosses and fungi live upon the cracked trunks, and
orchids&mdash;graceful guests&mdash;twine in loving embrace with the
foliage of the hospitable trees.</p>
<p class="par">Strange legends exist concerning this wood, which is
held in awe by the country folk. The most credible account, and
therefore the one least known and believed, seems to be this. When the
town was still a collection of miserable huts with the grass growing
abundantly in the so-called streets, at the time when the wild boar and
deer roamed about during the nights, there arrived in the place one day
an old, hollow-eyed Spaniard, who spoke Tagalog rather well. After
looking about and inspecting the land, he finally inquired for the
owners of this wood, in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2527"
href="#xd24e2527" name="xd24e2527">74</a>]</span>there were hot
springs. Some persons who claimed to be such presented themselves, and
the old man acquired it in exchange for clothes, jewels, and a sum of
money. Soon afterward he disappeared mysteriously. The people thought
that he had been spirited away, when a bad odor from the neighboring
wood attracted the attention of some herdsmen. Tracing this, they found
the decaying corpse of the old Spaniard hanging from the branch of a
balete tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2529src" href="#xd24e2529"
name="xd24e2529src">2</a> In life he had inspired fear by his deep,
hollow voice, his sunken eyes, and his mirthless laugh, but now, dead
by his own act, he disturbed the sleep of the women. Some threw the
jewels into the river and burned the clothes, and from the time that
the corpse was buried at the foot of the balete itself, no one
willingly ventured near the spot. A belated herdsman looking for some
of his strayed charges told of lights that he had seen there, and when
some venturesome youths went to the place they heard mournful cries. To
win the smiles of his disdainful lady, a forlorn lover agreed to spend
the night there and in proof to wrap around the trunk a long piece of
rattan, but he died of a quick fever that seized him the very next day.
Stories and legends still cluster about the place.</p>
<p class="par">A few months after the finding of the old
Spaniard&rsquo;s body there appeared a youth, apparently a Spanish
mestizo, who said that he was the son of the deceased. He established
himself in the place and devoted his attention to agriculture,
especially the raising of indigo. Don Saturnino was a silent young man
with a violent disposition, even cruel at times, yet he was energetic
and industrious. He surrounded the grave of his father with a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2537" href="#xd24e2537" name=
"xd24e2537">75</a>]</span>wall, but visited it only at rare intervals.
When he was along in years, he married a young woman from Manila, and
she became the mother of Don Rafael, the father of Crisostomo. From his
youth Don Rafael was a favorite with the country people. The
agricultural methods introduced and encouraged by his father spread
rapidly, new settlers poured in, the Chinese came, and the settlement
became a village with a native priest. Later the village grew into a
town, the priest died, and Fray Damaso came.</p>
<p class="par">All this time the tomb and the land around it remained
unmolested. Sometimes a crowd of boys armed with clubs and stones would
become bold enough to wander into the place to gather guavas, papayas,
lomboy, and other fruits, but it frequently happened that when their
sport was at its height, or while they gazed in awed silence at the
rotting piece of rope which still swung from the branch, stones would
fall, coming from they knew not where. Then with cries of &ldquo;The
old man! The old man!&rdquo; they would throw away fruit and clubs,
jump from the trees, and hurry between the rocks and through the
thickets; nor would they stop running until they were well out of the
wood, some pale and breathless, others weeping, and only a few
laughing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2541" href="#xd24e2541"

<p class="par first">Who were the caciques of the town?</p>
<p class="par">Don Rafael, when alive, even though he was the richest,
owned more land, and was the patron of nearly everybody, had not been
one of them. As he was modest and depreciated the value of his own
deeds, no faction in his favor had ever been formed in the town, and we
have already seen how the people all rose up against him when they saw
him hesitate upon being attacked.</p>
<p class="par">Could it be Capitan Tiago? True it was that when he went
there he was received with an orchestra by his debtors, who banqueted
him and heaped gifts upon him. The finest fruits burdened his table and
a quarter of deer or wild boar was his share of the hunt. If he found
the horse of a debtor beautiful, half an hour afterwards it was in his
stable. All this was true, but they laughed at him behind his back and
in secret called him &ldquo;Sacristan Tiago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps it was the gobernadorcillo?<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e2563src" href="#xd24e2563" name="xd24e2563src">1</a> No, for
he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2571" href="#xd24e2571" name=
"xd24e2571">77</a>]</span>only an unhappy mortal who commanded not, but
obeyed; who ordered not, but was ordered; who drove not, but was
driven. Nevertheless, he had to answer to the alcalde for having
commanded, ordered, and driven, just as if he were the originator of
everything. Yet be it said to his credit that he had never presumed
upon or usurped such honors, which had cost him five thousand pesos and
many humiliations. But considering the income it brought him, it was
cheap.</p>
<p class="par">Well then, might it be God? Ah, the good God disturbed
neither the consciences nor the sleep of the inhabitants. At least, He
did not make them tremble, and if by chance He might have been
mentioned in a sermon, surely they would have sighed longingly,
&ldquo;Oh, that only there were a God!&rdquo; To the good Lord they
paid little attention, as the saints gave them enough to do. For those
poor folk God had come to be like those unfortunate monarchs who are
surrounded by courtiers to whom alone the people render homage.</p>
<p class="par">San Diego was a kind of Rome: not the Rome of the time
when the cunning Romulus laid out its walls with a plow, nor of the
later time when, bathed in its own and others&rsquo; blood, it dictated
laws to the world&mdash;no, it was a Rome of our own times with the
difference that in place of marble monuments and colosseums it had its
monuments of sawali and its cockpit of nipa. The curate was the Pope in
the Vatican; the alferez of the Civil Guard, the King of Italy on the
Quirinal: all, it must be understood, on a scale of nipa and bamboo.
Here, as there, continual quarreling went on, since each wished to be
the master <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2577" href="#xd24e2577"
name="xd24e2577">78</a>]</span>and considered the other an intruder.
Let us examine the characteristics of each.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Bernardo Salvi was that silent young Franciscan of
whom we have spoken before. In his habits and manners he was quite
different from his brethren and even from his predecessor, the violent
Padre Damaso. He was thin and sickly, habitually pensive, strict in the
fulfilment of his religious duties, and careful of his good name. In a
month after his arrival nearly every one in the town had joined the
Venerable Tertiary Order, to the great distress of its rival, the
Society of the Holy Rosary. His soul leaped with joy to see about each
neck four or five scapularies and around each waist a knotted girdle,
and to behold the procession of corpses and ghosts in
<i>guing&oacute;n</i> habits. The senior sacristan made a small fortune
selling&mdash;or giving away as alms, we should say&mdash;all things
necessary for the salvation of the soul and the warfare against the
devil, as it is well known that this spirit, which formerly had the
temerity to contradict God himself face to face and to doubt His words,
as is related in the holy book of Job, who carried our Lord Christ
through the air as afterwards in the Dark Ages he carried the ghosts,
and continues, according to report, to carry the <i>asuang</i> of the
Philippines, now seems to have become so shamefaced that he cannot
endure the sight of a piece of painted cloth and that he fears the
knots on a cord. But all this proves nothing more than that there is
progress on this side also and that the devil is backward, or at least
a conservative, as are all who dwell in darkness. Otherwise, we must
attribute to him the weakness of a fifteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p class="par">As we have said, Fray Salvi was very assiduous in the
fulfilment of his duties, too assiduous, the alferez thought. While he
was preaching&mdash;he was very fond of preaching&mdash;the doors of
the church were closed, wherein he was like Nero, who allowed no one to
leave the theater while he was singing. But the former did it for the
salvation and the latter for the corruption of souls. Fray Salvi
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2589" href="#xd24e2589" name=
"xd24e2589">79</a>]</span>rarely resorted to blows, but was accustomed
to punish every shortcoming of his subordinates with fines. In this
respect he was very different from Padre Damaso, who had been
accustomed to settle everything with his fists or a cane, administering
such chastisement with the greatest good-will. For this, however, he
should not be judged too harshly, as he was firm in the belief that the
Indian could be managed only by beating him, just as was affirmed by a
friar who knew enough to write books, and Padre Damaso never disputed
anything that he saw in print, a credulity of which many might have
reason to complain. Although Fray Salvi made little use of violence,
yet, as an old wiseacre of the town said, what he lacked in quantity he
made up in quality. But this should not be counted against him, for the
fasts and abstinences thinned his blood and unstrung his nerves and, as
the people said, the wind got into his head. Thus it came about that it
was not possible to learn from the condition of the sacristans&rsquo;
backs whether the curate was fasting or feasting.</p>
<p class="par">The only rival of this spiritual power, with tendencies
toward the temporal, was, as we have said, the alferez: the only one,
since the women told how the devil himself would flee from the curate,
because, having one day dared to tempt him, he was caught, tied to a
bedpost, soundly whipped with a rope, and set at liberty only after
nine days. As a consequence, any one who after this would still be the
enemy of such a man, deserved to fall into worse repute than even the
weak and unwary devils.</p>
<p class="par">But the alferez deserved his fate. His wife was an old
Filipina of abundant rouge and paint, known as Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion&mdash;although her husband and some others called her by
quite another name. The alferez revenged his conjugal misfortunes on
his own person by getting so drunk that he made a tank of himself, or
by ordering his soldiers to drill in the sun while he remained in the
shade, or, more frequently, by beating up his consort, who, if she was
not a lamb of God to take away one&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2596" href="#xd24e2596" name=
"xd24e2596">80</a>]</span>sins, at least served to lay up for her
spouse many torments in Purgatory&mdash;if perchance he should get
there, a matter of doubt to the devout women. As if for the fun of it,
these two used to beat each other up beautifully, giving free shows to
the neighborhood with vocal and instrumental accompaniments,
four-handed, soft, loud, with pedal and all.</p>
<p class="par">Whenever these scandals reached the ears of Padre Salvi,
he would smile, cross himself, and recite a paternoster. They called
him a grafter, a hypocrite, a Carlist, and a miser: he merely smiled
and recited more prayers. The alferez had a little anecdote which he
always related to the occasional Spaniards who visited him:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you going over to the convento to visit the
sanctimonious rascal there, the little curate? Yes! Well, if he offers
you chocolate which I doubt&mdash;but if he offers it remember this: if
he calls to the servant and says, &lsquo;Juan, make a cup of chocolate,
<i>eh!</i>&rsquo; then stay without fear; but if he calls out,
&lsquo;Juan, make a cup of chocolate, <i>ah!</i>&rsquo; then take your
hat and leave on a run.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; the startled visitor would ask,
&ldquo;does he poison people? <i>Carambas!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, man, not at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Chocolate<i>, eh!</i>&rsquo; means thick
and rich, while &lsquo;chocolate, <i>ah!</i>&rsquo; means watered and
thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But we are of the opinion that this was a slander on the
part of the alferez, since the same story is told of many curates. At
least, it may be a thing peculiar to the Order.</p>
<p class="par">To make trouble for the curate, the soldier, at the
instigation of his wife, would prohibit any one from walking abroad
after nine o&rsquo;clock at night. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion would then
claim that she had seen the curate, disguised in a pi&ntilde;a camisa
and salakot, walking about late. Fray Salvi would take his revenge in a
holy manner. Upon seeing the alferez enter the church he would
innocently order the sacristan to close all the doors, and would then
go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2629" href="#xd24e2629" name=
"xd24e2629">81</a>]</span>up into the pulpit and preach until the very
saints closed their eyes and even the wooden dove above his head, the
image of the Holy Ghost, murmured for mercy. But the alferez, like all
the unregenerate, did not change his ways for this; he would go away
cursing, and as soon as he was able to catch a sacristan, or one of the
curate&rsquo;s servants, he would arrest him, give him a beating, and
make him scrub the floor of the barracks and that of his own house,
which at such times was put in a decent condition. On going to pay the
fine imposed by the curate for his absence, the sacristan would explain
the cause. Fray Salvi would listen in silence, take the money, and at
once turn out his goats and sheep so that they might graze in the
alferez&rsquo;s garden, while he himself looked up a new text for
another longer and more edifying sermon. But these were only little
pleasantries, and if the two chanced to meet they would shake hands and
converse politely.</p>
<p class="par">When her husband was sleeping off the wine he had drunk,
or was snoring through the siesta, and she could not quarrel with him,
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, in a blue flannel camisa, with a big cigar in
her mouth, would take her stand at the window. She could not endure the
young people, so from there she would scrutinize and mock the passing
girls, who, being afraid of her, would hurry by in confusion, holding
their breath the while, and not daring to raise their eyes. One great
virtue Do&ntilde;a Consolation possessed, and this was that she had

&ldquo;Petty governor,&rdquo; the chief municipal official, chosen
annually from among their own number, with the approval of the parish
priest and the central government, by the <i>principal&iacute;a</i>,
i.e., persons who owned considerable property or who had previously
held some municipal office. The manner of his selection is thus
described by a German traveler (Jagor) in the Philippines in 1860:
&ldquo;The election is held in the town hall. The governor or his
representative presides, having on his right the parish priest and on
his left a clerk, who also acts as interpreter. All the cabezas de
barangay, the gobernadorcillo, and those who have formerly occupied the
latter position, seat themselves on benches. First, there are chosen by
lot six cabezas de barangay and six ex-gobernadorcillos as electors,
the actual gobernadorcillo being the thirteenth. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2568" href="#xd24e2568" name=
"xd24e2568">77n</a>]</span>rest leave the hall. After the presiding
officer has read the statutes in a loud voice and reminded the electors
of their duty to act in accordance with their consciences and to heed
only the welfare of the town, the electors move to a table and write
three names on a slip of paper. The person receiving a majority of
votes is declared elected gobernadorcillo for the ensuing year,
provided that there is no protest from the curate or the electors, and
always conditioned upon the approval of the superior authority in
Manila, which is never withheld, since the influence of the curate is
enough to prevent an unsatisfactory
election.&rdquo;&mdash;TR.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The one thing perhaps that indisputably
distinguishes man from the brute creation is the attention which he
pays to those who have passed away and, wonder of wonders! this
characteristic seems to be more deeply rooted in proportion to the lack
of civilization. Historians relate that the ancient inhabitants of the
Philippines venerated and deified their ancestors; but now the contrary
is true, and the dead have to entrust themselves to the living. It is
also related that the people of New Guinea preserve the bones of their
dead in chests and maintain communication with them. The greater part
of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and America offer them the finest
products of their kitchens or dishes of what was their favorite food
when alive, and give banquets at which they believe them to be present.
The Egyptians raised up palaces and the Mussulmans built shrines, but
the masters in these things, those who have most clearly read the human
heart, are the people of Dahomey. These negroes know that man is
revengeful, so they consider that nothing will more content the dead
than to sacrifice all his enemies upon his grave, and, as man is
curious and may not know how to entertain himself in the other life,
each year they send him a newsletter under the skin of a beheaded
slave.</p>
<p class="par">We ourselves differ from all the rest. In spite of the
inscriptions on the tombs, hardly any one believes that the dead rest,
and much less, that they rest in peace. The most optimistic fancies his
forefathers still roasting in purgatory and, if it turns out that he
himself be not completely damned, he will yet be able to associate with
them for many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2647" href=
"#xd24e2647" name="xd24e2647">83</a>]</span>years. If any one would
contradict let him visit the churches and cemeteries of the country on
All Saints&rsquo; day and he will be convinced.</p>
<p class="par">Now that we are in San Diego let us visit its cemetery,
which is located in the midst of paddy-fields, there toward the
west&mdash;not a city, merely a village of the dead, approached by a
path dusty in dry weather and navigable on rainy days. A wooden gate
and a fence half of stone and half of bamboo stakes, appear to separate
it from the abode of the living but not from the curate&rsquo;s goats
and some of the pigs of the neighborhood, who come and go making
explorations among the tombs and enlivening the solitude with their
presence. In the center of this enclosure rises a large wooden cross
set on a stone pedestal. The storms have doubled over the tin plate for
the inscription INRI, and the rains have effaced the letters. At the
foot of the cross, as on the real Golgotha, is a confused heap of
skulls and bones which the indifferent grave-digger has thrown from the
graves he digs, and there they will probably await, not the
resurrection of the dead, but the coming of the animals to defile them.
Round about may be noted signs of recent excavations; here the earth is
sunken, there it forms a low mound. There grow in all their luxuriance
the <i>tarambulo</i> to prick the feet with its spiny berries and the
<i>pandakaki</i> to add its odor to that of the cemetery, as if the
place did not have smells enough already. Yet the ground is sprinkled
with a few little flowers which, like those skulls, are known only to
their Creator; their petals wear a pale smile and their fragrance is
the fragrance of the tombs. The grass and creepers fill up the corners
or climb over the walls and niches to cover and beautify the naked
ugliness and in places even penetrate into the fissures made by the
earthquakes, so as to hide from sight the revered hollowness of the
sepulcher.</p>
<p class="par">At the time we enter, the people have driven the animals
away, with the single exception of some old hog, an animal that is hard
to convince, who shows his small eyes and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e2659" href="#xd24e2659" name="xd24e2659">84</a>]</span>pulling
back his head from a great gap in the fence, sticks up his snout and
seems to say to a woman praying near, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat it all,
leave something for me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Two men are digging a grave near one of the tottering
walls. One of them, the grave-digger, works with indifference, throwing
about bones as a gardener does stones and dry branches, while the
other, more intent on his work, is perspiring, smoking, and spitting at
every moment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; says the latter in Tagalog,
&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be better for us to dig in some other place?
This is too recent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One grave is as recent as another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer! That bone
you&rsquo;re just cut in two has blood oozing from it&mdash;and those
hairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But how sensitive you are!&rdquo; was the
other&rsquo;s reproach. &ldquo;Just as if you were a town clerk! If,
like myself, you had dug up a corpse of twenty days, on a dark and
rainy night&mdash;! My lantern went out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His companion shuddered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The coffin burst open, the corpse fell half-way
out, it stunk&mdash;and supposing you had to carry it&mdash;the rain
wet us both&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ugh! And why did you dig it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger looked at him in surprise. &ldquo;Why?
How do I know? I was ordered to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who ordered you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger stepped backward and looked his
companion over from head to foot. &ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re like a
Spaniard, for afterwards a Spaniard asked me the same questions, but in
secret. So I&rsquo;m going to answer you as I answered the Spaniard:
the fat curate ordered me to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! And what did you do with the corpse
afterwards?&rdquo; further questioned the sensitive one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The devil! If I didn&rsquo;t know you and was not
sure that you are a <i>man</i> I would say that you were certainly a
Spaniard of the Civil Guard, since you ask questions just as he did.
Well, the fat curate ordered me to bury it in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2691" href="#xd24e2691" name=
"xd24e2691">85</a>]</span>the Chinamen&rsquo;s cemetery, but the coffin
was heavy and the Chinese cemetery far away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no! I&rsquo;m not going to dig any
more!&rdquo; the other interrupted in horror as he threw away his spade
and jumped out of the hole. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cut a skull in two and
I&rsquo;m afraid that it won&rsquo;t let me sleep tonight.&rdquo; The
old grave-digger laughed to see how the chicken-hearted fellow left,
crossing himself.</p>
<p class="par">The cemetery was filling up with men and women dressed
in mourning. Some sought a grave for a time, disputing among themselves
the while, and as if they were unable to agree, they scattered about,
each kneeling where he thought best. Others, who had niches for their
deceased relatives, lighted candles and fell to praying devoutly.
Exaggerated or suppressed sighs and sobs were heard amid the hum of
prayers, <i lang="la">orapreo, orapreiss, requiem-aeternams</i>, that
arose from all sides.</p>
<p class="par">A little old man with bright eyes entered bareheaded.
Upon seeing him many laughed, and some women knitted their eyebrows.
The old man did not seem to pay any attention to these demonstrations
as he went toward a pile of skulls and knelt to look earnestly for
something among the bones. Then he carefully removed the skulls one by
one, but apparently without finding what he sought, for he wrinkled his
brow, nodded his head from side to side, looked all about him, and
finally rose and approached the grave-digger, who raised his head when
the old man spoke to him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know where there is a beautiful skull,
white as the meat of a coconut, with a complete set of teeth, which I
had there at the foot of the cross under those leaves?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; added the old man, showing a silver
coin, &ldquo;I have only this, but I&rsquo;ll give it to you if you
find the skull for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The gleam of the silver caused the grave-digger to
consider, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2711" href="#xd24e2711"
name="xd24e2711">86</a>]</span>and staring toward the heap of bones he
said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it there? No? Then I don&rsquo;t know where it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? When those who owe me pay
me, I&rsquo;ll give you more,&rdquo; continued the old man. &ldquo;It
was the skull of my wife, so if you find it for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it there? Then I don&rsquo;t know!
But if you wish, I can give you another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like the grave you&rsquo;re
digging,&rdquo; apostrophized the old man nervously. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know the value of what you lose. For whom is that
grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; replied the other in
bad humor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For a corpse!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Like the grave, like the grave!&rdquo; repeated
the old man with a dry smile. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you
throw away nor what you receive! Dig, dig on!&rdquo; And he turned away
in the direction of the gate.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, the grave-digger had completed his task,
attested by the two mounds of fresh red earth at the sides of the
grave. He took some buyo from his salakot and began to chew it while he
stared stupidly at what was going on around him. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As the old man was leaving the cemetery there
stopped at the head of the path a carriage which, from its dust-covered
appearance and sweating horses, seemed to have come from a great
distance. Followed by an aged servant, Ibarra left the carriage and
dismissed it with a wave of his hand, then gravely and silently turned
toward the cemetery.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My illness and my duties have not permitted me to
return,&rdquo; said the old servant timidly. &ldquo;Capitan Tiago
promised that he would see that a niche was constructed, but I planted
some flowers on the grave and set up a cross carved by my own
hands.&rdquo; Ibarra made no reply. &ldquo;There behind that big cross,
sir,&rdquo; he added when they were well inside the gate, as he pointed
to the place.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra was so intent upon his quest that he did not
notice the movement of surprise on the part of the persons who
recognized him and suspended their prayers to watch him curiously. He
walked along carefully to avoid stepping on any of the graves, which
were easily distinguishable by the hollow places in the soil. In other
times he had walked on them carelessly, but now they were to be
respected: his father lay among them. When he reached the large cross
he stopped and looked all around. His companion stood confused and
confounded, seeking some mark in the ground, but nowhere was any cross
to be seen.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was it here?&rdquo; he murmured through his
teeth. &ldquo;No, there! But the ground has been disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra gave him a look of anguish.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I remember that
there was a stone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2745" href=
"#xd24e2745" name="xd24e2745">88</a>]</span>near it. The grave was
rather short. The grave-digger was sick, so a farmer had to dig it. But
let&rsquo;s ask that man what has become of the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They went over to where the grave-digger was watching
them with curiosity. He removed his salakot respectfully as they
approached.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can you tell me which is the grave there that had
a cross over it?&rdquo; asked the servant.</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger looked toward the place and reflected.
&ldquo;A big cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, a big one!&rdquo; affirmed the servant
eagerly, with a significant look at Ibarra, whose face lighted up.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A carved cross tied up with rattan?&rdquo;
continued the grave-digger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s it, like
this!&rdquo; exclaimed the servant in answer as he drew on the ground
the figure of a Byzantine cross.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Were there flowers scattered on the
grave?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oleanders and tuberoses and forget-me-nots,
yes!&rdquo; the servant added joyfully, offering the grave-digger a
cigar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell us which is the grave and where the cross
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger scratched his ear and answered with a
yawn: &ldquo;Well, as for the cross, I burned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Burned it? Why did you burn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because the fat curate ordered me to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who is the fat curate?&rdquo; asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who? Why, the one that beats people with a big
cane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra drew his hand across his forehead. &ldquo;But at
least you can tell us where the grave is. You must remember
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger smiled as he answered quietly,
&ldquo;But the corpse is no longer there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the grave-digger in a
half-jesting tone. &ldquo;I buried a woman in that place a week
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2786" href=
"#xd24e2786" name="xd24e2786">89</a>]</span>&ldquo;Are you
crazy?&rdquo; cried the servant. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been a year
since we buried him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true, but a good many months
ago I dug the body up. The fat curate ordered me to do so and to take
it to the cemetery of the Chinamen. But as it was heavy and there was
rain that night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was stopped by the threatening attitude of Ibarra,
who had caught him by the arm and was shaking him. &ldquo;Did you do
that?&rdquo; demanded the youth in an indescribable tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, sir,&rdquo; stammered the
pale and trembling grave-digger. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bury him among
the Chinamen. Better be drowned than lie among Chinamen, I said to
myself, so I threw the body into the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra placed both his hands on the grave-digger&rsquo;s
shoulders and stared at him for a long time with an indefinable
expression. Then, with the ejaculation, &ldquo;You are only a miserable
slave!&rdquo; he turned away hurriedly, stepping upon bones, graves,
and crosses, like one beside himself.</p>
<p class="par">The grave-digger patted his arm and muttered, &ldquo;All
the trouble dead men cause! The fat padre caned me for allowing it to
be buried while I was sick, and this fellow almost tore my arm off for
having dug it up. That&rsquo;s what these Spaniards are! I&rsquo;ll
lose my job yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra walked rapidly with a far-away look in his eyes,
while the aged servant followed him weeping. The sun was setting, and
over the eastern sky was flung a heavy curtain of clouds. A dry wind
shook the tree-tops and made the bamboo clumps creak. Ibarra went
bareheaded, but no tear wet his eyes nor did any sigh escape from his
breast. He moved as if fleeing from something, perhaps the shade of his
father, perhaps the approaching storm. He crossed through the town to
the outskirts on the opposite side and turned toward the old house
which he had not entered for so many years. Surrounded by a
cactus-covered wall it seemed to beckon to him with its open windows,
while the ilang-ilang waved its flower-laden branches joyfully
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2800" href="#xd24e2800" name=
"xd24e2800">90</a>]</span>and the doves circled about the conical roof
of their cote in the middle of the garden.</p>
<p class="par">But the youth gave no heed to these signs of welcome
back to his old home, his eyes being fixed on the figure of a priest
approaching from the opposite direction. It was the curate of San
Diego, the pensive Franciscan whom we have seen before, the rival of
the alferez. The breeze folded back the brim of his wide hat and blew
his <i>guing&oacute;n</i> habit closely about him, revealing the
outlines of his body and his thin, curved thighs. In his right hand he
carried an ivory-headed <i>palasan</i> cane.</p>
<p class="par">This was the first time that he and Ibarra had met. When
they drew near each other Ibarra stopped and gazed at him from head to
foot; Fray Salvi avoided the look and tried to appear unconcerned.
After a moment of hesitation Ibarra went up to him quickly and dropping
a heavy hand on his shoulder, asked in a husky voice, &ldquo;What did
you do with my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Salvi, pale and trembling as he read the deep
feelings that flushed the youth&rsquo;s face, could not answer; he
seemed paralyzed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did you do with my father?&rdquo; again
demanded the youth in a choking voice.</p>
<p class="par">The priest, who was gradually being forced to his knees
by the heavy hand that pressed upon his shoulder, made a great effort
and answered, &ldquo;You are mistaken, I did nothing to your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; went on the youth,
forcing him down upon his knees.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, I assure you! It was my predecessor, it was
Padre Damaso!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, releasing his
hold, and clapping his hand desperately to his brow; then, leaving poor
Fray Salvi, he turned away and hurried toward his house. The old
servant came up and helped the friar to his feet. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Tasio: Lunatic or Sage</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The peculiar old man wandered about the streets
aimlessly. A former student of philosophy, he had given up his career
in obedience to his mother&rsquo;s wishes and not from any lack of
means or ability. Quite the contrary, it was because his mother was
rich and he was said to possess talent. The good woman feared that her
son would become learned and forget God, so she had given him his
choice of entering the priesthood or leaving college. Being in love, he
chose the latter course and married. Then having lost both his wife and
his mother within a year, he sought consolation in his books in order
to free himself from sorrow, the cockpit, and the dangers of idleness.
He became so addicted to his studies and the purchase of books, that he
entirely neglected his fortune and gradually ruined himself. Persons of
culture called him Don Anastasio, or Tasio the Sage, while the great
crowd of the ignorant knew him as Tasio the Lunatic, on account of his
peculiar ideas and his eccentric manner of dealing with others.</p>
<p class="par">As we said before, the evening threatened to be stormy.
The lightning flashed its pale rays across the leaden sky, the air was
heavy and the slight breeze excessively sultry. Tasio had apparently
already forgotten his beloved skull, and now he was smiling as he
looked at the dark clouds. Near the church he met a man wearing an
alpaca coat, who carried in one hand a large bundle of candles and in
the other a tasseled cane, the emblem of his office as
gobernadorcillo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You seem to be merry?&rdquo; he greeted Tasio in
Tagalog.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2838" href=
"#xd24e2838" name="xd24e2838">92</a>]</span>&ldquo;Truly I am,
se&ntilde;or capitan, I&rsquo;m merry because I hope for
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah? What do you hope for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The storm? Are you thinking of taking a
bath?&rdquo; asked the gobernadorcillo in a jesting way as he stared at
the simple attire of the old man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A bath? That&rsquo;s not a bad idea, especially
when one has just stumbled over some trash!&rdquo; answered Tasio in a
similar, though somewhat more offensive tone, staring at the
other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But I hope for something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Some thunderbolts that will kill people and burn
down houses,&rdquo; returned the Sage seriously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask for the deluge at
once?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We all deserve it, even you and I! You,
se&ntilde;or gobernadorcillo, have there a bundle of tapers that came
from some Chinese shop, yet this now makes the tenth year that I have
been proposing to each new occupant of your office the purchase of
lightning-rods. Every one laughs at me, and buys bombs and rockets and
pays for the ringing of bells. Even you yourself, on the day after I
made my proposition, ordered from the Chinese founders a bell in honor
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Barbara,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e2860src" href="#xd24e2860" name="xd24e2860src">1</a> when science
has shown that it is dangerous to ring the bells during a storm.
Explain to me why in the year &rsquo;70, when lightning struck in
Bi&ntilde;an, it hit the very church tower and destroyed the clock and
altar. What was the bell of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Barbara
doing then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At the moment there was a vivid flash. &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Jes&uacute;s, Mar&iacute;a, y Jos&eacute;!</i> Holy <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Barbara!&rdquo; exclaimed the gobernadorcillo,
turning pale and crossing himself.</p>
<p class="par">Tasio burst out into a loud laugh. &ldquo;You are worthy
of your patroness,&rdquo; he remarked dryly in Spanish as he turned his
back and went toward the church.</p>
<p class="par">Inside, the sacristans were preparing a catafalque,
bordered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2880" href="#xd24e2880"
name="xd24e2880">93</a>]</span>with candles placed in wooden sockets.
Two large tables had been placed one above the other and covered with
black cloth across which ran white stripes, with here and there a skull
painted on it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is that for the souls or for the candles?&rdquo;
inquired the old man, but noticing two boys, one about ten and the
other seven, he turned to them without awaiting an answer from the
sacristans.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me, boys?&rdquo; he
asked them. &ldquo;Your mother has prepared a supper for you fit for a
curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The senior sacristan will not let us leave until
eight o&rsquo;clock, sir,&rdquo; answered the larger of the two boys.
&ldquo;I expect to get my pay to give it to our mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! And where are you going now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the belfry, sir, to ring the knell for the
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Going to the belfry! Then take care! Don&rsquo;t
go near the bells during the storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tasio then left the church, not without first bestowing
a look of pity on the two boys, who were climbing the stairway into the
organ-loft. He passed his hand over his eyes, looked at the sky again,
and murmured, &ldquo;Now I should be sorry if thunderbolts should
fall.&rdquo; With his head bowed in thought he started toward the
outskirts of the town.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; invited a voice
in Spanish from a window.</p>
<p class="par">The Sage raised his head and saw a man of thirty or
thirty-five years of age smiling at him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you reading there?&rdquo; asked Tasio,
pointing to a book the man held in his hand.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A work just published: &lsquo;The Torments
Suffered by the Blessed Souls in Purgatory,&rsquo;&rdquo; the other
answered with a smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Man, man, man!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sage in an
altered tone as he entered the house. &ldquo;The author must be a very
clever person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2908" href=
"#xd24e2908" name="xd24e2908">94</a>]</span>Upon reaching the top of
the stairway, he was cordially received by the master of the house, Don
Filipo Lino, and his young wife, Do&ntilde;a Teodora Vi&ntilde;a. Don
Filipo was the teniente-mayor of the town and leader of one of the
parties&mdash;the liberal faction, if it be possible to speak so, and
if there exist parties in the towns of the Philippines.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you meet in the cemetery the son of the
deceased Don Rafael, who has just returned from Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, I saw him as he alighted from his
carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They say that he went to look for his
father&rsquo;s grave. It must have been a terrible blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Sage shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t such a misfortune affect
you?&rdquo; asked the young wife.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know very well that I was one of the six who
accompanied the body, and it was I who appealed to the Captain-General
when I saw that no one, not even the authorities, said anything about
such an outrage, although I always prefer to honor a good man in life
rather than to worship him after his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, madam, I am not a believer in hereditary
monarchy. By reason of the Chinese blood which I have received from my
mother I believe a little like the Chinese: I honor the father on
account of the son and not the son on account of the father. I believe
that each one should receive the reward or punishment for his own
deeds, not for those of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you order a mass said for your dead wife, as
I advised you yesterday?&rdquo; asked the young woman, changing the
subject of conversation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the old man with a smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; she exclaimed with unfeigned
regret.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They say that until ten o&rsquo;clock tomorrow
the souls will wander at liberty, awaiting the prayers of the living,
and that during these days one mass is equivalent to five on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2935" href="#xd24e2935" name=
"xd24e2935">95</a>]</span>other days of the year, or even to six, as
the curate said this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What! Does that mean that we have a period
without paying, which we should take advantage of?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Doray,&rdquo; interrupted Don Filipo,
&ldquo;you know that Don Anastasio doesn&rsquo;t believe in
purgatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in purgatory!&rdquo;
protested the old man, partly rising from his seat. &ldquo;Even when I
know something of its history!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The history of purgatory!&rdquo; exclaimed the
couple, full of surprise. &ldquo;Come, relate it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know it and yet you order masses
and talk about its torments? Well, as it has begun to rain and
threatens to continue, we shall have time to relieve the
monotony,&rdquo; replied Tasio, falling into a thoughtful mood.</p>
<p class="par">Don Filipo closed the book which he held in his hand and
Doray sat down at his side determined not to believe anything that the
old man was about to say.</p>
<p class="par">The latter began in the following manner:
&ldquo;Purgatory existed long before Our Lord came into the world and
must have been located in the center of the earth, according to Padre
Astete; or somewhere near Cluny, according to the monk of whom Padre
Girard tells us. But the location is of least importance here. Now
then, who were scorching in those fires that had been burning from the
beginning of the world? Its very ancient existence is proved by
Christian philosophy, which teaches that God has created nothing new
since he rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it could have existed <i>in potentia</i> and
not <i>in actu</i>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2960src" href=
"#xd24e2960" name="xd24e2960src">2</a> observed Don Filipo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well! But yet I must answer that some knew
of it and as existing <i>in actu</i>. One of these was Zarathustra, or
Zoroaster, who wrote part of the Zend-Avesta and founded a religion
which in some points resembles ours, and Zarathustra, according to the
scholars, flourished at least eight hundred years before Christ. I say
&lsquo;at least,&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e2968" href=
"#xd24e2968" name="xd24e2968">96</a>]</span>since Gaffarel, after
examining the testimony of Plato, Xanthus of Lydia, Pliny, Hermippus,
and Eudoxus, believes it to have been two thousand five hundred years
before our era. However that may be, it is certain that Zarathustra
talked of a kind of purgatory and showed ways of getting free from it.
The living could redeem the souls of those who died in sin by reciting
passages from the Avesta and by doing good works, but under the
condition that the person offering the petitions should be a relative,
up to the fourth generation. The time for this occurred every year and
lasted five days. Later, when this belief had become fixed among the
people, the priests of that religion saw in it a chance of profit and
so they exploited &lsquo;the deep and dark prison where remorse
reigns,&rsquo; as Zarathustra called it. They declared that by the
payment of a small coin it was possible to save a soul from a year of
torture, but as in that religion there were sins punishable by three
hundred to a thousand years of suffering, such as lying, faithlessness,
failure to keep one&rsquo;s word, and so on, it resulted that the
rascals took in countless sums. Here you will observe something like
our purgatory, if you take into account the differences in the
religions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A vivid flash of lightning, followed by rolling thunder,
caused Doray to start up and exclaim, as she crossed herself:
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Jes&uacute;s, Mar&iacute;a, y Jos&eacute;!</i>
I&rsquo;m going to leave you, I&rsquo;m going to burn some sacred palm
and light candles of penitence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The rain began to fall in torrents. The Sage Tasio,
watching the young woman leave, continued: &ldquo;Now that she is not
here, we can consider this matter more rationally. Doray, even though a
little superstitious, is a good Catholic, and I don&rsquo;t care to
root out the faith from her heart. A pure and simple faith is as
distinct from fanaticism as the flame from smoke or music from
discords: only the fools and the deaf confuse them. Between ourselves
we can say that the idea of purgatory is good, holy, and rational. It
perpetuates the union of those who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e2977" href="#xd24e2977" name="xd24e2977">97</a>]</span>were and
those who are, leading thus to greater purity of life. The evil is in
its abuse.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But let us now see where Catholicism got this
idea, which does not exist in the Old Testament nor in the Gospels.
Neither Moses nor Christ made the slightest mention of it, and the
single passage which is cited from Maccabees is insufficient. Besides,
this book was declared apocryphal by the Council of Laodicea and the
holy Catholic Church accepted it only later. Neither have the pagan
religions anything like it. The oft-quoted passage in Virgil, <i>Aliae
panduntur inanes</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e2984src" href=
"#xd24e2984" name="xd24e2984src">3</a> which probably gave occasion for
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Gregory the Great to speak of
drowned souls, and to Dante for another narrative in his <i>Divine
Comedy</i>, cannot have been the origin of this belief. Neither the
Brahmins, the Buddhists, nor the Egyptians, who may have given Rome her
Charon and her Avernus, had anything like this idea. I won&rsquo;t
speak now of the religions of northern Europe, for they were religions
of warriors, bards, and hunters, and not of philosophers. While they
yet preserve their beliefs and even their rites under Christian forms,
they were unable to accompany the hordes in the spoliation of Rome or
to seat themselves on the Capitoline; the religions of the mists were
dissipated by the southern sun. Now then, the early Christians did not
believe in a purgatory but died in the blissful confidence of shortly
seeing God face to face. Apparently the first fathers of the Church who
mentioned it were <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clement of
Alexandria, Origen, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Irenaeus,
who were all perhaps influenced by Zarathustra&rsquo;s religion, which
still flourished and was widely spread throughout the East, since at
every step we read reproaches against Origen&rsquo;s Orientalism.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Irenaeus proved its existence by
the fact that Christ remained &lsquo;three days in the depths of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3021" href="#xd24e3021" name=
"xd24e3021">98</a>]</span>earth,&rsquo; three days of purgatory, and
deduced from this that every soul must remain there until the
resurrection of the body, although the &lsquo;<i lang="la">Hodie mecum
eris in Paradiso</i>&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3026src" href=
"#xd24e3026" name="xd24e3026src">4</a> seems to contradict it.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Augustine also speaks of purgatory
and, if not affirming its existence, yet he did not believe it
impossible, conjecturing that in another existence there might continue
the punishments that we receive in this life for our sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The devil with <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Augustine!&rdquo; ejaculated Don Filipo.
&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with what we suffer here but wished a
continuance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, so it went&rdquo; some believed it and
others didn&rsquo;t. Although <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Gregory finally came to admit it in his
<i lang="la">de quibusdam levibus culpis esse ante judicium purgatorius
ignis credendus est</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3046src" href=
"#xd24e3046" name="xd24e3046src">5</a> yet nothing definite was done
until the year 1439, that is, eight centuries later, when the Council
of Florence declared that there must exist a purifying fire for the
souls of those who have died in the love of God but without having
satisfied divine Justice. Lastly, the Council of Trent under Pius IV in
1563, in the twenty-fifth session, issued the purgatorial decree
beginning <i lang="la">Cura catholica ecclesia, Spiritu Santo
edocta</i>, wherein it deduces that, after the office of the mass, the
petitions of the living, their prayers, alms, and other pious works are
the surest means of freeing the souls. Nevertheless, the Protestants do
not believe in it nor do the Greek Fathers, since they reject any
Biblical authority for it and say that our responsibility ends with
death, and that the &lsquo;<i lang="la">Quodcumque ligaberis in
terra</i>,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3056src" href="#xd24e3056"
name="xd24e3056src">6</a> does not mean &lsquo;<i lang="la">usque ad
purgatorium,</i>&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3062src" href=
"#xd24e3062" name="xd24e3062src">7</a> but to this the answer can be
made that since purgatory is located in the center of the earth it fell
naturally under the control of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Peter. But I should never get through if I had
to relate all that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3068" href=
"#xd24e3068" name="xd24e3068">99</a>]</span>has been said on the
subject. Any day that you wish to discuss the matter with me, come to
my house and there we will consult the books and talk freely and
quietly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now I must go. I don&rsquo;t understand why
Christian piety permits robbery on this night&mdash;and you, the
authorities, allow it&mdash;and I fear for my books. If they should
steal them to read I wouldn&rsquo;t object, but I know that there are
many who wish to burn them in order to do for me an act of charity, and
such charity, worthy of the Caliph Omar, is to be dreaded. Some believe
that on account of those books I am already damned&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I suppose that you do believe in
damnation?&rdquo; asked Doray with a smile, as she appeared carrying in
a brazier the dry palm leaves, which gave off a peculiar smoke and an
agreeable odor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, madam, what God will do with
me,&rdquo; replied the old man thoughtfully. &ldquo;When I die I will
commit myself to Him without fear and He may do with me what He wishes.
But a thought strikes me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What thought is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If the only ones who can be saved are the
Catholics, and of them only five per cent&mdash;as many curates
say&mdash;and as the Catholics form only a twelfth part of the
population of the world&mdash;if we believe what statistics
show&mdash;it would result that after damning millions and millions of
men during the countless ages that passed before the Saviour came to
the earth, after a Son of God has died for us, it is now possible to
save only five in every twelve hundred. That cannot be so! I prefer to
believe and say with Job: &lsquo;Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and
fro, and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?&rsquo; No, such a calamity
is impossible and to believe it is blasphemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you wish? Divine Justice, divine
Purity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, but divine Justice and divine Purity saw the
future before the creation,&rdquo; answered the old man, as he rose
shuddering. &ldquo;Man is an accidental and not a necessary part of
creation, and that God cannot have created <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3084" href="#xd24e3084" name=
"xd24e3084">100</a>]</span>him, no indeed, only to make a few happy and
condemn hundreds to eternal misery, and all in a moment, for hereditary
faults! No! If that be true, strangle your baby son sleeping there! If
such a belief were not a blasphemy against that God, who must be the
Highest Good, then the Phenician Moloch, which was appeased with human
sacrifices and innocent blood, and in whose belly were burned the babes
torn from their mothers&rsquo; breasts, that bloody deity, that
horrible divinity, would be by the side of Him a weak girl, a friend, a
mother of humanity!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Horrified, the Lunatic&mdash;or the Sage&mdash;left the
house and ran along the street in spite of the rain and the darkness. A
lurid flash, followed by frightful thunder and filling the air with
deadly currents, lighted the old man as he stretched his hand toward
the sky and cried out: &ldquo;Thou protestest! I know that Thou art not
cruel, I know that I must only name Thee Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The flashes of lightning became more frequent and the
storm increased in violence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3090"

<p class="par first">The thunder resounded, roar following close upon
roar, each preceded&rsquo; by a blinding flash of zigzag lightning, so
that it might have been said that God was writing his name in fire and
that the eternal arch of heaven was trembling with fear. The rain,
whipped about in a different direction each moment by the mournfully
whistling wind, fell in torrents. With a voice full of fear the bells
sounded their sad supplication, and in the brief pauses between the
roars of the unchained elements tolled forth sorrowful peals, like
plaintive groans.</p>
<p class="par">On the second floor of the church tower were the two
boys whom we saw talking to the Sage. The younger, a child of seven
years with large black eyes and a timid countenance, was huddling close
to his brother, a boy of ten, whom he greatly resembled in features,
except that the look on the elder&rsquo;s face was deeper and
firmer.</p>
<p class="par">Both were meanly dressed in clothes full of rents and
patches. They sat upon a block of wood, each holding the end of a rope
which extended upward and was lost amid the shadows above. The
wind-driven rain reached them and snuffed the piece of candle burning
dimly on the large round stone that was used to furnish the thunder on
Good Friday by being rolled around the gallery.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pull on the rope, Crispin, pull!&rdquo; cried the
elder to his little brother, who did as he was told, so that from above
was heard a faint peal, instantly drowned out by the reechoing
thunder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, if we were only at home now with
mother,&rdquo; sighed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3106" href=
"#xd24e3106" name="xd24e3106">102</a>]</span>the younger, as he gazed
at his brother. &ldquo;There I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The elder did not answer; he was watching the melting
wax of the candle, apparently lost in thought.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There no one would say that I stole,&rdquo; went
on Crispin. &ldquo;Mother wouldn&rsquo;t allow it. If she knew that
they whip me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The elder took his gaze from the flame, raised his head,
and clutching the thick rope pulled violently on it so that a sonorous
peal of the bells was heard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are we always going to live this way,
brother?&rdquo; continued Crispin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get sick at
home tomorrow, I&rsquo;d like to fall into a long sickness so that
mother might take care of me and not let me come back to the convento.
So I&rsquo;d not be called a thief nor would they whip me. And you too,
brother, you must get sick with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the older, &ldquo;we should
all die: mother of grief and we of hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crispin remained silent for a moment, then asked,
&ldquo;How much will you get this month?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Two pesos. They&rsquo;re fined me
twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then pay what they say I&rsquo;ve stolen, so that
they won&rsquo;t call us thieves. Pay it, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you crazy, Crispin? Mother wouldn&rsquo;t
have anything to eat. The senior sacristan says that you&rsquo;ve
stolen two gold pieces, and they&rsquo;re worth thirty-two
pesos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The little one counted on his fingers up to thirty-two.
&ldquo;Six hands and two fingers over and each finger a peso!&rdquo; he
murmured thoughtfully. &ldquo;And each peso, how many
cuartos?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A hundred and sixty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A hundred and sixty cuartos? A hundred and sixty
times a cuarto? Goodness! And how many are a hundred and
sixty?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thirty-two hands,&rdquo; answered the older.</p>
<p class="par">Crispin looked hard at his little hands.
&ldquo;Thirty-two hands,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;six hands and two
fingers over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3137" href="#xd24e3137"
name="xd24e3137">103</a>]</span>and each finger thirty-two hands and
each finger a cuarto&mdash;goodness, what a lot of cuartos! I could
hardly count them in three days; and with them could be bought shoes
for our feet, a hat for my head when the sun shines hot, a big umbrella
for the rain, and food, and clothes for you and mother,
and&mdash;&rdquo; He became silent and thoughtful again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m sorry that I didn&rsquo;t
steal!&rdquo; he soon exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Crispin!&rdquo; reproached his brother.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry! The curate has said that
he&rsquo;ll beat me to death if the money doesn&rsquo;t appear, and if
I had stolen it I could make it appear. Anyhow, if I died you and
mother would at least have clothes. Oh, if I had only stolen
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The elder pulled on the rope in silence. After a time he
replied with a sigh: &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m afraid of is that mother
will scold you when she knows about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked the younger with
astonishment. &ldquo;You will tell her that they&rsquo;re whipped me
and I&rsquo;ll show the welts on my back and my torn pocket. I had only
one cuarto, which was given to me last Easter, but the curate took that
away from me yesterday. I never saw a prettier cuarto! No, mother
won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If the curate says so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crispin began to cry, murmuring between his sobs,
&ldquo;Then go home alone! I don&rsquo;t want to go. Tell mother that
I&rsquo;m sick. I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Crispin, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; pleaded the
elder. &ldquo;Mother won&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;don&rsquo;t cry! Old
Tasio told us that a fine supper is waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A fine supper! And I haven&rsquo;t eaten for a
long time. They won&rsquo;t give me anything to eat until the two gold
pieces appear. But, if mother believes it? You must tell her that the
senior sacristan is a liar but that the curate believes him and that
all of them are liars, that they say that we&rsquo;re thieves because
our father is a vagabond who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3159" href=
"#xd24e3159" name="xd24e3159">104</a>]</span>At that instant a head
appeared at the top of the stairway leading down to the floor below,
and that head, like Medusa&rsquo;s, froze the words on the
child&rsquo;s lips. It was a long, narrow head covered with black hair,
with blue glasses concealing the fact that one eye was sightless. The
senior sacristan was accustomed to appear thus without noise or warning
of any kind. The two brothers turned cold with fear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On you, Basilio, I impose a fine of two reals for
not ringing the bells in time,&rdquo; he said in a voice so hollow that
his throat seemed to lack vocal chords. &ldquo;You, Crispin, must stay
tonight, until what you stole reappears.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crispin looked at his brother as if pleading for
protection.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we already have permission&mdash;mother
expects us at eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; objected Basilio timidly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Neither shall you go home at eight, you&rsquo;ll
stay until ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, sir, after nine o&rsquo;clock no one is
allowed to be out and our house is far from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you trying to give me orders?&rdquo; growled
the man irritably, as he caught Crispin by the arm and started to drag
him away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, sir, it&rsquo;s been a week now since
we&rsquo;re seen our mother,&rdquo; begged Basilio, catching hold of
his brother as if to defend him.</p>
<p class="par">The senior sacristan struck his hand away and jerked at
Crispin, who began to weep as he fell to the floor, crying out to his
brother, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, they&rsquo;re going to kill
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The sacristan gave no heed to this and dragged him on to
the stairway. As they disappeared among the shadows below Basilio stood
speechless, listening to the sounds of his brother&rsquo;s body
striking against the steps. Then followed the sound of a blow and
heartrending cries that died away in the distance.</p>
<p class="par">The boy stood on tiptoe, hardly breathing and listening
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3182" href="#xd24e3182" name=
"xd24e3182">105</a>]</span>fixedly, with his eyes unnaturally wide and
his fists clenched. &ldquo;When shall I be strong enough to plow a
field?&rdquo; he muttered between his teeth as he started below
hastily. Upon reaching the organ-loft he paused to listen; the voice of
his brother was fast dying away in the distance and the cries of
&ldquo;Mother! Brother!&rdquo; were at last completely cut off by the
sound of a closing door. Trembling and perspiring, he paused for a
moment with his fist in his mouth to keep down a cry of anguish. He let
his gaze wander about the dimly lighted church where an oil-lamp gave a
ghostly light, revealing the catafalque in the center. The doors were
closed and fastened, and the windows had iron bars on them. Suddenly he
reascended the stairway to the place where the candle was burning and
then climbed up into the third floor of the belfry. After untying the
ropes from the bell-clappers he again descended. He was pale and his
eyes glistened, but not with tears.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, the rain was gradually ceasing and the sky
was clearing. Basilio knotted the ropes together, tied one end to a
rail of the balustrade, and without even remembering to put out the
light let himself down into the darkness outside. A few moments later
voices were heard on one of the streets of the town, two shots
resounded, but no one seemed to be alarmed and silence again reigned.

<h2 class="label">Chapter XVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Sisa</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Through the dark night the villagers slept. The
families who had remembered their dead gave themselves up to quiet and
satisfied sleep, for they had recited their requiems, the novena of the
souls, and had burned many wax tapers before the sacred images. The
rich and powerful had discharged the duties their positions imposed
upon them. On the following day they would hear three masses said by
each priest and would give two pesos for another, besides buying a bull
of indulgences for the dead. Truly, divine justice is not nearly so
exacting as human.</p>
<p class="par">But the poor and indigent who earn scarcely enough to
keep themselves alive and who also have to pay tribute to the petty
officials, clerks, and soldiers, that they may be allowed to live in
peace, sleep not so tranquilly as gentle poets who have perhaps not
felt the pinches of want would have us believe. The poor are sad and
thoughtful, for on that night, if they have not recited many prayers,
yet they have prayed much&mdash;with pain in their eyes and tears in
their hearts. They have not the novenas, nor do they know the
responsories, versicles, and prayers which the friars have composed for
those who lack original ideas and feelings, nor do they understand
them. They pray in the language of their misery: their souls weep for
them and for those dead beings whose love was their wealth. Their lips
may proffer the salutations, but their minds cry out complaints,
charged with lamentations. Wilt Thou be satisfied, O Thou who blessedst
poverty, and you, O suffering souls, with the simple prayers of the
poor, offered before a rude picture in the light of a dim wick, or do
you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3196" href="#xd24e3196" name=
"xd24e3196">107</a>]</span>perhaps desire wax tapers before bleeding
Christs and Virgins with small mouths and crystal eyes, and masses in
Latin recited mechanically by priests? And thou, Religion preached for
suffering humanity, hast thou forgotten thy mission of consoling the
oppressed in their misery and of humiliating the powerful in their
pride? Hast thou now promises only for the rich, for those who, can pay
thee?</p>
<p class="par">The poor widow watches among the children who sleep at
her side. She is thinking of the indulgences that she ought to buy for
the repose of the souls of her parents and of her dead husband.
&ldquo;A peso,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;a peso is a week of happiness
for my children, a week of laughter and joy, my savings for a month, a
dress for my daughter who is becoming a woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it is
necessary that you put aside these worldly desires,&rdquo; says the
voice that she heard in the pulpit, &ldquo;it is necessary that you
make sacrifices.&rdquo; Yes, it is necessary. The Church does not
gratuitously save the beloved souls for you nor does it distribute
indulgences without payment. You must buy them, so tonight instead of
sleeping you should work. Think of your daughter, so poorly clothed!
Fast, for heaven is dear! Decidedly, it seems that the poor enter not
into heaven. Such thoughts wander through the space enclosed between
the rough mats spread out on the bamboo floor and the ridge of the
roof, from which hangs the hammock wherein the baby swings. The
infant&rsquo;s breathing is easy and peaceful, but from time to time he
swallows and smacks his lips; his hungry stomach, which is not
satisfied with what his older brothers have given him, dreams of
eating.</p>
<p class="par">The cicadas chant monotonously, mingling their ceaseless
notes with the trills of the cricket hidden in the grass, or the chirp
of the little lizard which has come out in search of food, while the
big gekko, no longer fearing the water, disturbs the concert with its
ill-omened voice as it shows its head from out the hollow of the
decayed tree-trunk.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3203" href=
"#xd24e3203" name="xd24e3203">108</a>]</span>The dogs howl mournfully
in the streets and superstitious folk, hearing them, are convinced that
they see spirits and ghosts. But neither the dogs nor the other animals
see the sorrows of men&mdash;yet how many of these exist!</p>
<p class="par">Distant from the town an hour&rsquo;s walk lives the
mother of Basilio and Crispin. The wife of a heartless man, she
struggles to live for her sons, while her husband is a vagrant gamester
with whom her interviews are rare but always painful. He has gradually
stripped her of her few jewels to pay the cost of his vices, and when
the suffering Sisa no longer had anything that he might take to satisfy
his whims, he had begun to maltreat her. Weak in character, with more
heart than intellect, she knew only how to love and to weep. Her
husband was a god and her sons were his angels, so he, knowing to what
point he was loved and feared, conducted himself like all false gods:
daily he became more cruel, more inhuman, more wilful. Once when he had
appeared with his countenance gloomier than ever before, Sisa had
consulted him about the plan of making a sacristan of Basilio, and he
had merely continued to stroke his game-cock, saying neither yes nor
no, only asking whether the boy would earn much money. She had not
dared to insist, but her needy situation and her desire that the boys
should learn to read and write in the town school forced her to carry
out the plan. Still her husband had said nothing.</p>
<p class="par">That night, between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock, when
the stars were glittering in a sky now cleared of all signs of the
storm of the early evening, Sisa sat on a wooden bench watching some
fagots that smouldered upon the fireplace fashioned of rough pieces of
natural rock. Upon a tripod, or <i>tunko</i>, was a small pot of
boiling rice and upon the red coals lay three little dried fishes such
as are sold at three for two cuartos. Her chin rested in the palm of
her hand while she gazed at the weak yellow glow peculiar to the cane,
which burns rapidly and leaves embers that quickly grow pale. A sad
smile lighted up her face as she recalled <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3212" href="#xd24e3212" name="xd24e3212">109</a>]</span>a funny
riddle about the pot and the fire which Crispin had once propounded to
her. The boy said: &ldquo;The black man sat down and the red man looked
at him, a moment passed, and cock-a-doodle-doo rang forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sisa was still young, and it was plain that at one time
she had been pretty and attractive. Her eyes, which, like her
disposition, she had given to her sons, were beautiful, with long
lashes and a deep look. Her nose was regular and her pale lips curved
pleasantly. She was what the Tagalogs call
<i>kayumanguing-kalig&aacute;tan</i>; that is, her color was a clear,
pure brown. In spite of her youthfulness, pain and perhaps even hunger
had begun to make hollow her pallid cheeks, and if her abundant hair,
in other times the delight and adornment of her person, was even yet
simply and neatly arranged, though without pins or combs, it was not
from coquetry but from habit.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa had been for several days confined to the house
sewing upon some work which had been ordered for the earliest possible
time. In order to earn the money, she had not attended mass that
morning, as it would have taken two hours at least to go to the town
and return: poverty obliges one to sin! She had finished the work and
delivered it but had received only a promise of payment. All that day
she had been anticipating the pleasures of the evening, for she knew
that her sons were coming and she had intended to make them some
presents. She had bought some small fishes, picked the most beautiful
tomatoes in her little garden, as she knew that Crispin was very fond
of them, and begged from a neighbor, old Tasio the Sage, who lived half
a mile away, some slices of dried wild boar&rsquo;s meat and a leg of
wild duck, which Basilio especially liked. Full of hope, she had cooked
the whitest of rice, which she herself had gleaned from the
threshing-floors. It was indeed a curate&rsquo;s meal for the poor
boys.</p>
<p class="par">But by an unfortunate chance her husband came and ate
the rice, the slices of wild boar&rsquo;s meat, the duck leg, five of
the little fishes, and the tomatoes. Sisa said nothing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3224" href="#xd24e3224" name=
"xd24e3224">110</a>]</span>although she felt as if she herself were
being eaten. His hunger at length appeased, he remembered to ask for
the boys. Then Sisa smiled happily and resolved that she would not eat
that night, because what remained was not enough for three. The father
had asked for their sons and that for her was better than eating.</p>
<p class="par">Soon he picked up his game-cock and started away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see them?&rdquo; she
asked tremulously. &ldquo;Old Tasio told me that they would be a little
late. Crispin now knows how to read and perhaps Basilio will bring his
wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This last reason caused the husband to pause and waver,
but his good angel triumphed. &ldquo;In that case keep a peso for
me,&rdquo; he said as he went away.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa wept bitterly, but the thought of her sons soon
dried her tears. She cooked some more rice and prepared the only three
fishes that were left: each would have one and a half.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have good appetites,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;the
way is long and hungry stomachs have no heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So she sat, he ear strained to catch every sound,
listening to the lightest footfalls: strong and clear, Basilio; light
and irregular, Crispin&mdash;thus she mused. The <i>kalao</i> called in
the woods several times after the rain had ceased, but still her sons
did not come. She put the fishes inside the pot to keep them warm and
went to the threshold of the hut to look toward the road. To keep
herself company, she began to sing in a low voice, a voice usually so
sweet and tender that when her sons listened to her singing the
<i>kund&iacute;man</i> they wept without knowing why, but tonight it
trembled and the notes were halting. She stopped singing and gazed
earnestly into the darkness, but no one was coming from the
town&mdash;that noise was only the wind shaking the raindrops from the
wide banana leaves.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly a black dog appeared before her dragging
something along the path. Sisa was frightened but caught up a stone and
threw it at the dog, which ran away howling mournfully. She was not
superstitious, but she had heard <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3244" href="#xd24e3244" name="xd24e3244">111</a>]</span>so much
about presentiments and black dogs that terror seized her. She shut the
door hastily and sat down by the light. Night favors credulity and the
imagination peoples the air with specters. She tried to pray, to call
upon the Virgin and upon God to watch over her sons, especially her
little Crispin. Then she forgot her prayers as her thoughts wandered to
think about them, to recall the features of each, those features that
always wore a smile for her both asleep and awake. Suddenly she felt
her hair rise on her head and her eyes stared wildly; illusion or
reality, she saw Crispin standing by the fireplace, there where he was
wont to sit and prattle to her, but now he said nothing as he gazed at
her with those large, thoughtful eyes, and smiled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother, open the door! Open, mother!&rdquo; cried
the voice of Basilio from without.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa shuddered violently and the vision disappeared.

<div class="epigraph">
<p lang="es" class="par first">La vida es sue&ntilde;o.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Basilio was scarcely inside when he staggered and
fell into his mother&rsquo;s arms. An inexplicable chill seized Sisa as
she saw him enter alone. She wanted to speak but could make no sound;
she wanted to embrace her son but lacked the strength; to weep was
impossible. At sight of the blood which covered the boy&rsquo;s
forehead she cried in a tone that seemed to come from a breaking heart,
&ldquo;My sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, mother,&rdquo; Basilio
reassured her. &ldquo;Crispin stayed at the convento.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At the convento? He stayed at the convento? Is he
alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boy raised his eyes to her. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she
sighed, passing from the depths of sorrow to the heights of joy. She
wept and embraced her son, covering his bloody forehead with
kisses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Crispin is alive! You left him at the convento!
But why are you wounded, my son? Have you had a fall?&rdquo; she
inquired, as she examined him anxiously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The senior sacristan took Crispin away and told
me that I could not leave until ten o&rsquo;clock, but it was already
late and so I ran away. In the town the soldiers challenged me, I
started to run, they fired, and a bullet grazed my forehead. I was
afraid they would arrest me and beat me and make me scrub out the
barracks, as they did with Pablo, who is still sick from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My God, my God!&rdquo; murmured his mother,
shuddering. &ldquo;Thou hast saved him!&rdquo; Then while she sought
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3273" href="#xd24e3273" name=
"xd24e3273">113</a>]</span>bandages, water, vinegar, and a feather, she
went on, &ldquo;A finger&rsquo;s breadth more and they would have
killed you, they would have killed my boy! The civil-guards do not
think of the mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must say that I fell from a tree so that no
one will know they chased me,&rdquo; Basilio cautioned her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why did Crispin stay?&rdquo; asked Sisa, after
dressing her son&rsquo;s wound.</p>
<p class="par">Basilio hesitated a few moments, then with his arms
about her and their tears mingling, he related little by little the
story of the gold pieces, without speaking, however, of the tortures
they were inflicting upon his young brother.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My good Crispin! To accuse my good Crispin!
It&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re poor and we poor people have to endure
everything!&rdquo; murmured Sisa, staring through her tears at the
light of the lamp, which was now dying out from lack of oil. So they
remained silent for a while.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had any supper yet? Here are
rice and fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything, only a little
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his mother sadly, &ldquo;I
know that you don&rsquo;t like dried fish. I had prepared something
else, but your father came.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Father came?&rdquo; asked Basilio, instinctively
examining the face and hands of his mother.</p>
<p class="par">The son&rsquo;s questioning gaze pained Sisa&rsquo;s
heart, for she understood it only too well, so she added hastily:
&ldquo;He came and asked a lot about you and wanted to see you, and he
was very hungry. He said that if you continued to be so good he would
come back to stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">An exclamation of disgust from Basilio&rsquo;s
contracted lips interrupted her. &ldquo;Son!&rdquo; she reproached
him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Forgive me, mother,&rdquo; he answered seriously.
&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t we three better off&mdash;you, Crispin, and I?
You&rsquo;re crying&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t said anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sisa sighed and asked, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to
eat? Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3300" href="#xd24e3300"
name="xd24e3300">114</a>]</span>let&rsquo;s go to sleep, for it&rsquo;s
now very late.&rdquo; She then closed up the hut and covered the few
coals with ashes so that the fire would not die out entirely, just as a
man does with his inner feelings; he covers them with the ashes of his
life, which he calls indifference, so that they may not be deadened by
daily contact with his fellows.</p>
<p class="par">Basilio murmured his prayers and lay down near his
mother, who was upon her knees praying. He felt hot and cold, he tried
to close his eyes as he thought of his little brother who that night
had expected to sleep in his mother&rsquo;s lap and who now was
probably trembling with terror and weeping in some dark corner of the
convento. His ears were again pierced with those cries he had heard in
the church tower. But wearied nature soon began to confuse his ideas
and the veil of sleep descended upon his eyes.</p>
<p class="par">He saw a bedroom where two dim tapers burned. The
curate, with a rattan whip in his hand, was listening gloomily to
something that the senior sacristan was telling him in a strange tongue
with horrible gestures. Crispin quailed and turned his tearful eyes in
every direction as if seeking some one or some hiding-place. The curate
turned toward him and called to him irritably, the rattan whistled. The
child ran to hide himself behind the sacristan, who caught and held
him, thus exposing him to the curate&rsquo;s fury. The unfortunate boy
fought, kicked, screamed, threw himself on the floor and rolled about.
He picked himself up, ran, slipped, fell, and parried the blows with
his hands, which, wounded, he hid quickly, all the time shrieking with
pain. Basilio saw him twist himself, strike the floor with his head, he
saw and heard the rattan whistle. In desperation his little brother
rose. Mad with pain he threw himself upon his tormentor and bit him on
the hand. The curate gave a cry and dropped the rattan&mdash;the
sacristan caught up a heavy cane and struck the boy a blow on the head
so that he fell stunned&mdash;the curate, seeing him down, trampled him
with his feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3307" href=
"#xd24e3307" name="xd24e3307">115</a>]</span>But the child no longer
defended himself nor did he cry out; he rolled along the floor, a
lifeless mass that left a damp track.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3309src" href="#xd24e3309" name="xd24e3309src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Sisa&rsquo;s voice brought him back to reality.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Why are you crying?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I dreamed&mdash;O God!&rdquo; exclaimed Basilio,
sitting up, covered with perspiration. &ldquo;It was a dream! Tell me,
mother, that it was only a dream! Only a dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did you dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boy did not answer, but sat drying his tears and
wiping away the perspiration. The hut was in total darkness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A dream, a dream!&rdquo; repeated Basilio in
subdued tones.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell me what you dreamed. I can&rsquo;t
sleep,&rdquo; said his mother when he lay down again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;I
dreamed that we had gone to glean the rice-stalks&mdash;in a field
where there were many flowers&mdash;the women had baskets full of
rice-stalks the men too had baskets full of rice-stalks&mdash;and the
children too&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember any more, mother, I
don&rsquo;t remember the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sisa had no faith in dreams, so she did not insist.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;ve thought of a plan
tonight,&rdquo; said Basilio after a few moments&rsquo; silence.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3347" href=
"#xd24e3347" name="xd24e3347">116</a>]</span>&ldquo;What is your
plan?&rdquo; she asked. Sisa was humble in everything, even with her
own sons, trusting their judgment more than her own.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a sacristan any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen, mother, to what I&rsquo;ve been thinking
about. Today there arrived from Spain the son of the dead Don Rafael,
and he will be a good man like his father. Well now, mother, tomorrow
you will get Crispin, collect my wages, and say that I will not be a
sacristan any longer. As soon as I get well I&rsquo;ll go to see Don
Crisostomo and ask him to hire me as a herdsman of his cattle and
carabaos&mdash;I&rsquo;m now big enough. Crispin can study with old
Tasio, who does not whip and who is a good man, even if the curate does
not believe so. What have we to fear now from the padre? Can he make us
any poorer than we are? You may believe it, mother, the old man is
good. I&rsquo;ve seen him often in the church when no one else was
about, kneeling and praying, believe it. So, mother, I&rsquo;ll stop
being a sacristan. I earn but little and that little is taken away from
me in fines. Every one complains of the same thing. I&rsquo;ll be a
herdsman and by performing my tasks carefully I&rsquo;ll make my
employer like me. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll let us milk a cow so that we can
drink milk&mdash;Crispin likes milk so much. Who can tell! Maybe
they&rsquo;ll give us a little calf if they see that I behave well and
we&rsquo;ll take care of it and fatten it like our hen. I&rsquo;ll pick
fruits in the woods and sell them in the town along with the vegetables
from our garden, so we&rsquo;ll have money. I&rsquo;ll set snares and
traps to catch birds and wild cats,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3355src"
href="#xd24e3355" name="xd24e3355src">2</a> I&rsquo;ll fish in the
river, and when I&rsquo;m bigger, I&rsquo;ll hunt. I&rsquo;ll be able
also to cut firewood to sell or to present to the owner of the cows,
and so he&rsquo;ll be satisfied with us. When I&rsquo;m able to plow,
I&rsquo;ll ask him to let me have a piece of land to plant in
sugar-cane or corn and you won&rsquo;t have to sew until midnight.
We&rsquo;ll <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3358" href="#xd24e3358"
name="xd24e3358">117</a>]</span>have new clothes for every fiesta,
we&rsquo;ll eat meat and big fish, we&rsquo;ll live free, seeing each
other every day and eating together. Old Tasio says that Crispin has a
good head and so we&rsquo;ll send him to Manila to study. I&rsquo;ll
support him by working hard. Isn&rsquo;t that fine, mother? Perhaps
he&rsquo;ll be a doctor, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What can I say but yes?&rdquo; said Sisa as she
embraced her son. She noted, however, that in their future the boy took
no account of his father, and shed silent tears.</p>
<p class="par">Basilio went on talking of his plans with the confidence
of the years that see only what they wish for. To everything Sisa said
yes&mdash;everything appeared good.</p>
<p class="par">Sleep again began to weigh down upon the tired eyelids
of the boy, and this time Ole-Luk-Oie, of whom Andersen tells us,
spread over him his beautiful umbrella with its pleasing pictures. Now
he saw himself with his little brother as they picked guavas, alpay,
and other fruits in the woods; they clambered from branch to branch,
light as butterflies; they penetrated into the caves and saw the
shining rocks; they bathed in the springs where the sand was gold-dust
and the stones like the jewels in the Virgin&rsquo;s crown. The little
fishes sang and laughed, the plants bent their branches toward them
laden with golden fruit. Then he saw a bell hanging in a tree with a
long rope for ringing it; to the rope was tied a cow with a
bird&rsquo;s nest between her horns and Crispin was inside the
bell.</p>
<p class="par">Thus he went on dreaming, while his mother, who was not
of his age and who had not run for an hour, slept not. <span class=

was taken prisoner by the insurgents and by them made

information concerning the insurgents&rsquo; preparations and plans, he

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning
when Fray Salvi finished celebrating his last mass, having offered up
three in the space of an hour. &ldquo;The padre is ill,&rdquo;
commented the pious women. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t move about with his
usual slowness and elegance of manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He took off his vestments without the least comment,
without saying a word or looking at any one. &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo;
whispered the sacristans among themselves. &ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s to
pay! It&rsquo;s going to rain fines, and all on account of those two
brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He left the sacristy to go up into the rectory, in the
hallway of which there awaited him some seven or eight women seated
upon benches and a man who was pacing back and forth. Upon seeing him
approach, the women arose and one of them pressed forward to kiss his
hand, but the holy man made a sign of impatience that stopped her
short.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can it be that you&rsquo;ve lost a real,
<i>kuriput?</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the woman with a jesting laugh,
offended at such a reception. &ldquo;Not to give his hand to me, Matron
of the Sisterhood, Sister Rufa!&rdquo; It was an unheard-of
proceeding.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t go into the confessional this
morning,&rdquo; added Sister Sipa, a toothless old woman. &ldquo;I
wanted to confess myself so as to receive communion and get the
indulgences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry for you,&rdquo; commented a
young woman with a frank face. &ldquo;This week I earned three plenary
indulgences and dedicated them to the soul of my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Badly done, Sister Juana,&rdquo; said the
offended Rufa. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3391" href=
"#xd24e3391" name="xd24e3391">119</a>]</span>&ldquo;One plenary
indulgence was enough to get him out of purgatory. You ought not to
squander the holy indulgences. Do as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I thought, so many more the better,&rdquo;
answered the simple Sister Juana, smiling. &ldquo;But tell me what you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sister Rufa did not answer at once. First, she asked for
a buyo and chewed at it, gazed at her audience, which was listening
attentively, then spat to one side and commenced, chewing at the buyo
meanwhile: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t misspend one holy day! Since I&rsquo;ve
belonged to the Sisterhood I&rsquo;ve earned four hundred and
fifty-seven plenary indulgences, seven hundred sixty thousand five
hundred and ninety-eight years of indulgence. I set down all that I
earn, for I like to have clean accounts. I don&rsquo;t want to cheat or
be cheated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here Sister Rufa paused to give more attention to her
chewing. The women gazed at her in admiration, but the man who was
pacing back and forth remarked with some disdain, &ldquo;Well, this
year I&rsquo;ve gained four plenary indulgences more than you have,
Sister Rufa, and a hundred years more, and that without praying much
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;More than I? More than six hundred and
eighty-nine plenary indulgences or nine hundred ninety-four thousand
eight hundred and fifty-six years?&rdquo; queried Rufa, somewhat
disgruntled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, eight indulgences and a hundred
fifteen years more and a few months over,&rdquo; answered the man, from
whose neck hung soiled scapularies and rosaries.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not strange!&rdquo; admitted Rufa,
at last admitting defeat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an expert, the best in
the province.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The flattered man smiled and continued, &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t so wonderful that I earn more than you do. Why, I can
almost say that even when sleeping I earn indulgences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And what do you do with them, sir?&rdquo; asked
four or five voices at the same time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; answered the man with a gesture of
proud disdain. &ldquo;I have them to throw away!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3413" href=
"#xd24e3413" name="xd24e3413">120</a>]</span>&ldquo;But in that I
can&rsquo;t commend you, sir,&rdquo; protested Rufa.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to purgatory for wasting the indulgences. You
know very well that for every idle word one must suffer forty days in
fire, according to the curate; for every span of thread uselessly
wasted, sixty days; and for every drop of water spilled, twenty.
You&rsquo;ll go to purgatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll know how to get out,&rdquo;
answered Brother Pedro with sublime confidence. &ldquo;How many souls
have I saved from the flames! How many saints have I made! Besides,
even <i>in articulo mortis</i> I can still earn, if I wish, at least
seven plenary indulgences and shall be able to save others as I
die.&rdquo; So saying, he strode proudly away.</p>
<p class="par">Sister Rufa turned to the others: &ldquo;Nevertheless,
you must do as I do, for I don&rsquo;t lose a single day and I keep my
accounts well. I don&rsquo;t want to cheat or be cheated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, what do you do?&rdquo; asked Juana.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must imitate what I do. For example, suppose
I earn a year of indulgence: I set it down in my account-book and say,
&lsquo;Most Blessed Father and Lord <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Dominic, please see if there is anybody in
purgatory who needs exactly a year&mdash;neither a day more nor a day
less.&rsquo; Then I play heads and tails: if it comes heads, no; if
tails, yes. Let&rsquo;s suppose that it comes tails, then I write down
<i>paid</i>; if it comes heads, then I keep the indulgence. In this way
I arrange groups of a hundred years each, of which I keep a careful
account. It&rsquo;s a pity that we can&rsquo;t do with them as with
money&mdash;put them out at interest, for in that way we should be able
to save more souls. Believe me, and do as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I do it a better way,&rdquo; remarked
Sister Sipa.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What? Better?&rdquo; demanded the astonished
Rufa. &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be! My system can&rsquo;t be improved
upon!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen a moment and you&rsquo;ll be convinced,
Sister,&rdquo; said old Sipa in a tone of vexation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How is it? Let&rsquo;s hear!&rdquo; exclaimed the
others.</p>
<p class="par">After coughing ceremoniously the old woman began with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3443" href="#xd24e3443" name=
"xd24e3443">121</a>]</span>great care: &ldquo;You know very well that
by saying the <i>Bendita sea tu pureza</i> and the <i>Se&ntilde;or
m&iacute;o Jesucristo, Padre dulc&iacute;simo por el gozo</i>, ten
years are gained for each letter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Twenty!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, less!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Five!&rdquo; interrupted several voices.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A few years more or less make no difference. Now,
when a servant breaks a plate, a glass, or a cup, I make him pick up
the pieces; and for every scrap, even the very smallest, he has to
recite for me one of those prayers. The indulgences that I earn in this
way I devote to the souls. Every one in my house, except the cats,
understands this system.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But those indulgences are earned by the servants
and not by you, Sister Sipa,&rdquo; objected Rufa.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And my cups and plates, who pays for them? The
servants are glad to pay for them in that way and it suits me also. I
never resort to blows, only sometimes a pinch, or a whack on the
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do as you do!&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the same!&rdquo; &ldquo;And I!&rdquo; exclaimed
the women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But suppose the plate is only broken into two or
three pieces, then you earn very few,&rdquo; observed the obstinate
Rufa.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;!</i>&rdquo; answered old Sipa.
&ldquo;I make them recite the prayers anyhow. Then I glue the pieces
together again and so lose nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sister Rufa had no more objections left.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Allow me to ask about a doubt of mine,&rdquo;
said young Juana timidly. &ldquo;You ladies understand so well these
matters of heaven, purgatory, and hell, while I confess that I&rsquo;m
ignorant. Often I find in the novenas and other books this direction:
three paternosters, three Ave Marias, and three Gloria
Patris&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now I want to know how they should be recited:
whether three paternosters in succession, three Ave Marias <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3477" href="#xd24e3477" name=
"xd24e3477">122</a>]</span>in succession, and three Gloria Patris in
succession; or a paternoster, an Ave Maria, and a Gloria Patri
together, three times?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This way: a paternoster three
times&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me, Sister Sipa,&rdquo; interrupted Rufa,
&ldquo;they must be recited in the other way. You mustn&rsquo;t mix up
males and females. The paternosters are males, the Ave Marias are
females, and the Gloria Patris are the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Eh? Excuse me, Sister Rufa: paternoster, Ave
Maria, and Gloria are like rice, meat, and sauce&mdash;a mouthful for
the saints&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong! You&rsquo;ll see, for you who
pray that way will never get what you ask for.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you who pray the other way won&rsquo;t get
anything from your novenas,&rdquo; replied old Sipa.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; asked Rufa, rising.
&ldquo;A short time ago I lost a little pig, I prayed to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony and found it, and then I sold it for a
good price. <i lang="tl">Ab&aacute;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes? Then that&rsquo;s why one of your neighbors
was saying that you sold a pig of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who? The shameless one! Perhaps I&rsquo;m like
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here the expert had to interfere to restore peace, for
no one was thinking any more about paternosters&mdash;the talk was all
about pigs. &ldquo;Come, come, there mustn&rsquo;t be any quarrel over
a pig, Sisters! The Holy Scriptures give us an example to follow. The
heretics and Protestants didn&rsquo;t quarrel with Our Lord for driving
into the water a herd of swine that belonged to them, and we that are
Christians and besides, Brethren of the Holy Rosary, shall we have hard
words on account of a little pig! What would our rivals, the Tertiary
Brethren, say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All became silent before such wisdom, at the same time
fearing what the Tertiary Brethren might say. The expert, well
satisfied with such acquiescence, changed his tone and continued:
&ldquo;Soon the curate will send for us. We must tell him which
preacher we&rsquo;ve chosen of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3506" href="#xd24e3506" name="xd24e3506">123</a>]</span>three
that he suggested yesterday, whether Padre Damaso, Padre Martin, or the
coadjutor. I don&rsquo;t know whether the Tertiary Brethren have yet
made any choice, so we must decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The coadjutor,&rdquo; murmured Juana timidly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ahem! The coadjutor doesn&rsquo;t know how to
preach,&rdquo; declared Sipa. &ldquo;Padre Martin is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre Martin!&rdquo; exclaimed another
disdainfully. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any voice. Padre Damaso would be
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried Rufa.
&ldquo;Padre Damaso surely does know how to preach! He looks like a
comedian!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t understand him,&rdquo;
murmured Juana.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s very deep! And as he preaches
well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This speech was interrupted by the arrival of Sisa, who
was carrying a basket on her head. She saluted the Sisters and went on
up the stairway.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going in! Let&rsquo;s go in
too!&rdquo; they exclaimed. Sisa felt her heart beating violently as
she ascended the stairs. She did not know just what to say to the padre
to placate his wrath or what reasons she could advance in defense of
her son. That morning at the first flush of dawn she had gone into her
garden to pick the choicest vegetables, which she placed in a basket
among banana-leaves and flowers; then she had looked along the bank of
the river for the <i>pak&oacute;</i> which she knew the curate liked
for salads. Putting on her best clothes and without awakening her son,
she had set out for the town with the basket on her head. As she went
up the stairway she, tried to make as little noise as possible and
listened attentively in the hope that she might hear a fresh, childish
voice, so well known to her. But she heard nothing nor did she meet any
one as she made her way to the kitchen. There she looked into all the
corners. The servants and sacristans received her coldly, scarcely
acknowledging her greeting.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where can I put these vegetables?&rdquo; she
asked, not taking any offense at their coldness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There, anywhere!&rdquo; growled the cook, hardly
looking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3532" href="#xd24e3532"
name="xd24e3532">124</a>]</span>at her as he busied himself in picking
the feathers from a capon.</p>
<p class="par">With great care Sisa arranged the vegetables and the
salad leaves on the table, placing the flowers above them. Smiling, she
then addressed one of the servants, who seemed to be more approachable
than the cook: &ldquo;May I speak with the padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sick,&rdquo; was the whispered
answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And Crispin? Do you know if he is in the
sacristy?&rdquo; The servant looked surprised and wrinkled his
eyebrows. &ldquo;Crispin? Isn&rsquo;t he at your house? Do you mean to
deny it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Basilio is at home, but Crispin stayed
here,&rdquo; answered Sisa, &ldquo;and I want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, he stayed, but afterwards he ran away, after
stealing a lot of things. Early this morning the curate ordered me to
go and report it to the Civil Guard. They must have gone to your house
already to hunt for the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sisa covered her ears and opened her mouth to speak, but
her lips moved without giving out any sound.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A pretty pair of sons you have!&rdquo; exclaimed
the cook. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain that you&rsquo;re a faithful wife,
the sons are so like the father. Take care that the younger
doesn&rsquo;t surpass him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sisa broke out into bitter weeping and let herself fall
upon a bench.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry here!&rdquo; yelled the cook.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that the padre&rsquo;s sick? Get out in the
street and cry!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The unfortunate mother was almost shoved down the
stairway at the very time when the Sisters were coming down,
complaining and making conjectures about the curate&rsquo;s illness, so
she hid her face in her pa&ntilde;uelo and suppressed the sounds of her
grief. Upon reaching the street she looked about uncertainly for a
moment and then, as if having reached a decision, walked rapidly away.

<p class="par first">The mountain-encircled lake slept peacefully with
that hypocrisy of the elements which gave no hint of how its waters had
the night before responded to the fury of the storm. As the first
reflections of light awoke on its surface the phosphorescent spirits,
there were outlined in the distance, almost on the horizon, the gray
silhouettes of the little bankas of the fishermen who were taking in
their nets and of the larger craft spreading their sails. Two men
dressed in deep mourning stood gazing at the water from a little
elevation: one was Ibarra and the other a youth of humble aspect and
melancholy features.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; the latter was saying.
&ldquo;From here your father&rsquo;s body was thrown into the water.
Here&rsquo;s where the grave-digger brought Lieutenant Guevara and
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra warmly grasped the hand of the young man, who
went on: &ldquo;You have no occasion to thank me. I owed many favors to
your father, and the only thing that I could do for him was to
accompany his body to the grave. I came here without knowing any one,
without recommendation, and having neither name nor fortune, just as at
present. My predecessor had abandoned the school to engage in the
tobacco trade. Your father protected me, secured me a house, and
furnished whatever was necessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3578" href="#xd24e3578" name="xd24e3578">126</a>]</span>for
running the school. He used to visit the classes and distribute
pictures among the poor but studious children, as well as provide them
with books and paper. But this, like all good things, lasted only a
little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra took off his hat and seemed to be praying for a
time. Then he turned to his companion: &ldquo;Did you say that my
father helped the poor children? And now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now they get along as well as possible and write
when they can,&rdquo; answered the youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The reason lies in their torn camisas and their
downcast eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How many pupils have you now?&rdquo; asked Ibarra
with interest, after a pause.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;More than two hundred on the roll but only about
twenty-five in actual attendance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How does that happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The schoolmaster smiled sadly as he answered, &ldquo;To
tell you the reasons would make a long and tiresome story.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t attribute my question to idle
curiosity,&rdquo; replied Ibarra gravely, while he stared at the
distant horizon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought better of it and believe
that to carry out my father&rsquo;s ideas will be more fitting than to
weep for him, and far better than to revenge him. Sacred nature has
become his grave, and his enemies were the people and a priest. The
former I pardon on account of their ignorance and the latter because I
wish that Religion, which elevated society, should be respected. I wish
to be inspired with the spirit of him who gave me life and therefore
desire to know about the obstacles encountered here in educational
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The country will bless your memory, sir,&rdquo;
said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;if you carry out the beautiful plans of
your dead father! You wish to know the obstacles which the progress of
education meets? Well then, under present circumstances, without
substantial aid education will never amount to much; in the very first
place because, even when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3601" href=
"#xd24e3601" name="xd24e3601">127</a>]</span>we have the pupils, lack
of suitable means, and other things that attract them more, kill off
their interest. It is said that in Germany a peasant&rsquo;s son
studies for eight years in the town school, but who here would spend
half that time when such poor results are to be obtained? They read,
write, and memorize selections, and sometimes whole books, in Spanish,
without understanding a single word.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3603src" href="#xd24e3603" name="xd24e3603src">2</a> What benefit
does our country child get from the school?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And why have you, who see the evil, not thought
of remedying it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The schoolmaster shook his head sadly. &ldquo;A poor
teacher struggles not only against prejudices but also against certain
influences. First, it would be necessary to have a suitable place and
not to do as I must at present&mdash;hold the classes under the
convento by the side of the padre&rsquo;s carriage. There the children,
who like to read aloud, very naturally disturb the padre, and he often
comes down, nervous, especially when he has his attacks, yells at them,
and even insults me at times. You know that no one can either teach or
learn under such circumstances, for the child will not respect his
teacher when he sees him abused without standing up for his rights. In
order to be heeded and to maintain his authority the teacher needs
prestige, reputation, moral strength, and some freedom of action.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3617" href=
"#xd24e3617" name="xd24e3617">128</a>]</span>&ldquo;Now let me recount
to you even sadder details. I have wished to introduce reforms and have
been laughed at. In order to remedy the evil of which I just spoke to
you, I tried to teach Spanish to the children because, in addition to
the fact that the government so orders, I thought also that it would be
of advantage for everybody. I used the simplest method of words and
phrases without paying any attention to long rules, expecting to teach
them grammar when they should understand the language. At the end of a
few weeks some of the brightest were almost able to understand me and
could use a few phrases.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The schoolmaster paused and seemed to hesitate, then, as
if making a resolution, he went on: &ldquo;I must not be ashamed of the
story of my wrongs, for any one in my place would have acted the same
as I did. As I said, it was a good beginning, but a few days afterwards
Padre Damaso, who was the curate then, sent for me by the senior
sacristan. Knowing his disposition and fearing to make him wait, I went
upstairs at once, saluted him, and wished him good-morning in Spanish.
His only greeting had been to put out his hand for me to kiss, but at
this he drew it back and without answering me began to laugh loud and
mockingly. I was very much embarrassed, as the senior sacristan was
present. At the moment I didn&rsquo;t know just what to say, for the
curate continued his laughter and I stood staring at him. Then I began
to get impatient and saw that I was about to do something indiscreet,
since to be a good Christian and to preserve one&rsquo;s dignity are
not incompatible. I was going to put a question to him when suddenly,
passing from ridicule to insult, he said sarcastically, &lsquo;So
it&rsquo;s <i lang="es">buenos dias, eh? Buenos dias!</i> How nice that
you know how to talk Spanish!&rsquo; Then again he broke out into
laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra was unable to repress a smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You smile,&rdquo; continued the schoolmaster,
following Ibarra&rsquo;s example, &ldquo;but I must confess that at the
time I had very little desire to laugh. I was still standing&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3628" href="#xd24e3628" name=
"xd24e3628">129</a>]</span>felt the blood rush to my head and lightning
seemed to flash through my brain. The curate I saw far, far away. I
advanced to reply to him without knowing just what I was going to say,
but the senior sacristan put himself between us. Padre Damaso arose and
said to me in Tagalog: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t try to shine in borrowed
finery. Be content to talk your own dialect and don&rsquo;t spoil
Spanish, which isn&rsquo;t meant for you. Do you know the teacher
Ciruela?<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3630src" href="#xd24e3630" name=
"xd24e3630src">3</a> Well, Ciruela was a teacher who didn&rsquo;t know
how to read, and he had a school.&rsquo; I wanted to detain him, but he
went into his bedroom and slammed the door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What was I to do with only my meager salary, to
collect which I have to get the curate&rsquo;s approval and make a trip
to the capital of the province, what could I do against him, the
foremost religious and political power in the town, backed up by his
Order, feared by the government, rich, powerful, sought after and
listened to, always believed and heeded by everybody? Although he
insulted me, I had to remain silent, for if I replied he would have had
me removed from my position, by which I should lose all hope in my
chosen profession. Nor would the cause of education gain anything, but
the opposite, for everybody would take the curate&rsquo;s side, they
would curse me and call me presumptuous, proud, vain, a bad Christian,
uncultured, and if not those things, then anti-Spanish and a
filibuster. Of a schoolmaster neither learning nor zeal is expected;
resignation, humility, and inaction only are asked. May God pardon me
if I have gone against my conscience and my judgement, but I was born
in this country, I have to live, I have a mother, so I have abandoned
myself to my fate like a corpse tossed about by the waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did this difficulty discourage you for all time?
Have you lived so since?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Would that it had been a warning to me! If only
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3643" href="#xd24e3643" name=
"xd24e3643">130</a>]</span>my troubles had been limited to that! It is
true that from that time I began to dislike my profession and thought
of seeking some other occupation, as my predecessor had done, because
any work that is done in disgust and shame is a kind of martyrdom and
because every day the school recalled the insult to my mind, causing me
hours of great bitterness. But what was I to do? I could not undeceive
my mother, I had to say to her that her three years of sacrifice to
give me this profession now constituted my happiness. It is necessary
to make her believe that this profession is most honorable, the work
delightful, the way strewn with flowers, that the performance of my
duties brings me only friendship, that the people respect me and show
me every consideration. By doing otherwise, without ceasing to be
unhappy myself, I should have caused more sorrow, which besides being
useless would also be a sin. I stayed on, therefore, and tried not to
feel discouraged. I tried to struggle on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here he paused for a while, then resumed: &ldquo;From
the day on which I was so grossly insulted I began to examine myself
and I found that I was in fact very ignorant. I applied myself day and
night to the study of Spanish and whatever concerned my profession. The
old Sage lent me some books, and I read and pondered over everything
that I could get hold of. With the new ideas that I have been acquiring
in one place and another my point of view has changed and I have seen
many things under a different aspect from what they had appeared to me
before. I saw error where before I had seen only truth, and truth in
many things where I had formerly seen only error. Corporal punishment,
for example, which from time immemorial has been the distinctive
feature in the schools and which has heretofore been considered as the
only efficacious means of making pupils learn&mdash;so we have been
accustomed to believe&mdash;soon appeared to me to be a great hindrance
rather than in any way an aid to the child&rsquo;s progress. I became
convinced that it was impossible to use one&rsquo;s mind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3647" href="#xd24e3647" name=
"xd24e3647">131</a>]</span>properly when blows, or similar punishment,
were in prospect. Fear and terror disturb the most serene, and a
child&rsquo;s imagination, besides being very lively, is also very
impressionable. As it is on the brain that ideas are impressed, it is
necessary that there be both inner and outer calm, that there be
serenity of spirit, physical and moral repose, and willingness, so I
thought that before everything else I should cultivate in the children
confidence, assurance, and some personal pride. Moreover, I
comprehended that the daily sight of floggings destroyed kindness in
their hearts and deadened all sense of dignity, which is such a
powerful lever in the world. At the same time it caused them to lose
their sense of shame, which is a difficult thing to restore. I have
also observed that when one pupil is flogged, he gets comfort from the
fact that the others are treated in the same way, and that he smiles
with satisfaction upon hearing the wails of the others. As for the
person who does the flogging, while at first he may do it with
repugnance, he soon becomes hardened to it and even takes delight in
his gloomy task. The past filled me with horror, so I wanted to save
the present by modifying the old system. I endeavored to make study a
thing of love and joy, I wished to make the primer not a black book
bathed in the tears of childhood but a friend who was going to reveal
wonderful secrets, and of the schoolroom not a place of sorrows but a
scene of intellectual refreshment. So, little by little, I abolished
corporal punishment, taking the instruments of it entirely away from
the school and replacing them with emulation and personal pride. If one
was careless about his lesson, I charged it to lack of desire and never
to lack of capacity. I made them think that they were more capable than
they really were, which urged them on to study just as any confidence
leads to notable achievements. At first it seemed that the change of
method was impracticable; many ceased their studies, but I persisted
and observed that little by little their minds were being elevated and
that more children came, that they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3649" href="#xd24e3649" name="xd24e3649">132</a>]</span>came with
more regularity, and that he who was praised in the presence of the
others studied with double diligence on the next day.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It soon became known throughout the town that I
did not whip the children. The curate sent for me, and fearing another
scene I greeted him curtly in Tagalog. On this occasion he was very
serious with me. He said that I was exposing the children to
destruction, that I was wasting time, that I was not fulfilling my
duties, that the father who spared the rod was spoiling the
child&mdash;according to the Holy Ghost&mdash;that learning enters with
blood, and so on. He quoted to me sayings of barbarous times just as if
it were enough that a thing had been said by the ancients to make it
indisputable; according to which we ought to believe that there really
existed those monsters which in past ages were imaged and sculptured in
the palaces and temples. Finally, he charged me to be more careful and
to return to the old system, otherwise he would make unfavorable report
about me to the alcalde of the province. Nor was this the end of my
troubles. A few days afterward some of the parents of the children
presented themselves under the convento and I had to call to my aid all
my patience and resignation. They began by reminding me of former times
when teachers had character and taught as their grandfathers had.
&lsquo;Those indeed were the times of the wise men,&rsquo; they
declared, &lsquo;they whipped, and straightened the bent tree. They
were not boys but old men of experience, gray-haired and severe. Don
Catalino, king of them all and founder of this very school, used to
administer no less than twenty-five blows and as a result his pupils
became wise men and priests. Ah, the old people were worth more than we
ourselves, yes, sir, more than we ourselves!&rsquo; Some did not
content themselves with such indirect rudeness, but told me plainly
that if I continued my system their children would learn nothing and
that they would be obliged to take them from the school It was useless
to argue with them, for as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3653"
href="#xd24e3653" name="xd24e3653">133</a>]</span>young man they
thought me incapable of sound judgment. What would I not have given for
some gray hairs! They cited the authority of the curate, of this one
and that one, and even called attention to themselves, saying that if
it had not been for the whippings they had received from their teachers
they would never have learned anything. Only a few persons showed any
sympathy to sweeten for me the bitterness of such a disillusioning.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In view of all this I had to give up my system,
which, after so much toil, was just beginning to produce results. In
desperation I carried the whips bank to the school the next day and
began the barbarous practice again. Serenity disappeared and sadness
reigned in the faces of the children, who had just begun to care for
me, and who were my only kindred and friends. Although I tried to spare
the whippings and to administer them with all the moderation possible,
yet the children felt the change keenly, they became discouraged and
wept bitterly. It touched my heart, and even though in my own mind I
was vexed with the stupid parents, still I was unable to take any spite
out on those innocent victims of their parents&rsquo; prejudices. Their
tears burned me, my heart seemed bursting from my breast, and that day
I left the school before closing-time to go home and weep alone.
Perhaps my sensitiveness may seem strange to you, but if you had been
in my place you would understand it. Old Don Anastasio said to me,
&lsquo;So the parents want floggings? Why not inflict them on
themselves?&rsquo; As a result of it all I became sick.&rdquo; Ibarra
was listening thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Scarcely had I recovered when I returned to the
school to find the number of my pupils reduced to a fifth. The better
ones had run away upon the return to the old system, and of those who
remained&mdash;mostly those who came to school to escape work at
home&mdash;not one showed any joy, not one congratulated me on my
recovery. It would have been the same to them whether I got well or
not, or they might have preferred that I continue sick since my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3659" href="#xd24e3659" name=
"xd24e3659">134</a>]</span>substitute, although he whipped them more,
rarely went to the school. My other pupils, those whose parents had
obliged them to attend school, had gone to other places. Their parents
blamed me for having spoiled them and heaped reproaches on me for it.
One, however, the son of a country woman who visited me during my
illness, had not returned on account of having been made a sacristan,
and the senior sacristan says that the sacristans must not attend
school: they would be dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Were you resigned in looking after your new
pupils?&rdquo; asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What else could I do?&rdquo; was the queried
reply. &ldquo;Nevertheless, during my illness many things had happened,
among them a change of curates, so I took new hope and made another
attempt to the end that the children should not lose all their time and
should, in so far as possible, get some benefit from the floggings,
that such things might at least have some good result for them. I
pondered over the matter, as I wished that even if they could not love
me, by getting something useful from me, they might remember me with
less bitterness. You know that in nearly all the schools the books are
in Spanish, with the exception of the catechism in Tagalog, which
varies according to the religious order to which the curate belongs.
These books are generally novenas, canticles, and the Catechism of
Padre Astete,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3665src" href="#xd24e3665"
name="xd24e3665src">4</a> from which they learn about as much piety as
they would from the books of heretics. Seeing the impossibility of
teaching the pupils in Spanish or of translating so many books, I tried
to substitute short passages from useful works in Tagalog, such as the
Treatise on Manners by Hortensio y Feliza, some manuals of Agriculture,
and so forth. Sometimes I would myself translate simple works, such as
Padre Barranera&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3677" href=
"#xd24e3677" name="xd24e3677">135</a>]</span>History of the
Philippines, which I then dictated to the children, with at times a few
observations of my own, so that they might make note-books. As I had no
maps for teaching geography, I copied one of the province that I saw at
the capital and with this and the tiles of the floor I gave them some
idea of the country. This time it was the women who got excited. The
men contented themselves with smiling, as they saw in it only one of my
vagaries. The new curate sent for me, and while he did not reprimand
me, yet he said that I should first take care of religion, that before
learning such things the children must pass an examination to show that
they had memorized the mysteries, the canticles, and the catechism of
Christian Doctrine.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So then, I am now working to the end that the
children become changed into parrots and know by heart so many things
of which they do not understand a single word. Many of them now know
the mysteries and the canticles, but I fear that my efforts will come
to grief with the Catechism of Padre Astete, since the greater part of
the pupils do not distinguish between the questions and the answers,
nor do they understand what either may mean. Thus we shall die, thus
those unborn will do, while in Europe they will talk of
progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not be so pessimistic,&rdquo; said
Ibarra. &ldquo;The teniente-mayor has sent me an invitation to attend a
meeting in the town hall. Who knows but that there you may find an
answer to your questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The schoolmaster shook his head in doubt as he answered:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see how the plan of which they talked to me meets
the same fate as mine has. But yet, let us see!&rdquo; <span class=

&ldquo;The schools are under the inspection of the parish priests.
Reading and writing in Spanish are taught, or at least it is so
ordered; but the schoolmaster himself usually does not know it, and on
the other hand the Spanish government employees do not understand the
vernacular. Besides, the curates, in order to preserve their influence
intact, do not look favorably upon the spread of Castilian. About the
only ones who know Spanish are the Indians who have been in the service
of Europeans. The first reading exercise is some devotional book, then
the catechism; the reader is called <i>Casaysayan</i>. On the average

learn to read fairly well and some to write a little, but they soon

<h2 class="label">Chapter XX</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Meeting in the Town Hall</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The hall was about twelve to fifteen meters long
by eight to ten wide. Its whitewashed walls were covered with drawings
in charcoal, more or less ugly and obscene, with inscriptions to
complete their meanings. Stacked neatly against the wall in one corner
were to be seen about a dozen old flint-locks among rusty swords and
talibons, the armament of the cuadrilleros.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3694src" href="#xd24e3694" name="xd24e3694src">1</a> At one end
of the hall there hung, half hidden by soiled red curtains, a picture
of his Majesty, the King of Spain. Underneath this picture, upon a
wooden platform, an old chair spread out its broken arms. In front of
the chair was a wooden table spotted with ink stains and whittled and
carved with inscriptions and initials like the tables in the German
taverns frequented by students. Benches and broken chairs completed the
furniture.</p>
<p class="par">This is the hall of council, of judgment, and of
torture, wherein are now gathered the officials of the town and its
dependent villages. The faction of old men does not mix with that of
the youths, for they are mutually hostile. They represent respectively
the conservative and the liberal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3702" href="#xd24e3702" name="xd24e3702">137</a>]</span>parties,
save that their disputes assume in the towns an extreme character.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The conduct of the gobernadorcillo fills me with
distrust,&rdquo; Don Filipo, the teniente-mayor and leader of the
liberal faction, was saying to his friends. &ldquo;It was a deep-laid
scheme, this thing of putting off the discussion of expenses until the
eleventh hour. Remember that we have scarcely eleven days
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And he has staved at the convento to hold a
conference with the curate, who is sick,&rdquo; observed one of the
youths.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; remarked another.
&ldquo;We have everything prepared. Just so the plan of the old men
doesn&rsquo;t receive a majority&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it will,&rdquo; interrupted
Don Filipo, &ldquo;as I shall present the plan of the old men
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What! What are you saying?&rdquo; asked his
surprised hearers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I said that if I speak first I shall present the
plan of our rivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what about our plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall leave it to you to present ours,&rdquo;
answered Don Filipo with a smile, turning toward a youthful cabeza de
barangay.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3721src" href="#xd24e3721" name=
"xd24e3721src">2</a> &ldquo;You will propose it after I have been
defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rdquo; said
his hearers, staring at him with doubtful looks.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; continued the liberal leader in a
low voice to several near him. &ldquo;This morning I met old Tasio and
the old man said to me: &lsquo;Your rivals hate you more than they do
your ideas. Do you wish that a thing shall <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3728" href="#xd24e3728" name=
"xd24e3728">138</a>]</span>not be done? Then propose it yourself, and
though it were more useful than a miter, it would be rejected. Once
they have defeated you, have the least forward person in the whole
gathering propose what you want, and your rivals, in order to humiliate
you, will accept it.&rsquo; But keep quiet about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So I will propose the plan of our rivals and
exaggerate it to the point of making it ridiculous. Ah, here come
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra and the schoolmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These two young men saluted each of the groups without
joining either. A few moments later the gobernadorcillo, the very same
individual whom we saw yesterday carrying a bundle of candles, entered
with a look of disgust on his face. Upon his entrance the murmurs
ceased, every one sat down, and silence was gradually established, as
he took his seat under the picture of the King, coughed four or five
times, rubbed his hand over his face and head, rested his elbows on the
table, then withdrew them, coughed once more, and then the whole thing
over again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he at last began in an unsteady
voice, &ldquo;I have been so bold as to call you together here for this
meeting&mdash;ahem! Ahem! We have to celebrate the fiesta of our patron
saint, San Diego, on the twelfth of this month&mdash;ahem!&mdash;today
is the second&mdash;ahem! Ahem!&rdquo; At this point a slow, dry cough
cut off his speech.</p>
<p class="par">A man of proud bearing, apparently about forty years of
age, then arose from the bench of the elders. He was the rich Capitan
Basilio, the direct contrast of Don Rafael, Ibarra&rsquo;s father. He
was a man who maintained that after the death of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas the world had made no more
progress, and that since <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;John
Lateran had left it, humanity had been retrograding.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gentlemen, allow me to speak a few words about
such an interesting matter,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I speak first even
though there are others here present who have more right to do so than
I have, but I speak first because in these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3748" href="#xd24e3748" name=
"xd24e3748">139</a>]</span>matters it seems to me that by speaking
first one does not take the first place&mdash;no more than that by
speaking last does one become the least. Besides, the things that I
have to say are of such importance that they should not be put off or
last spoken of, and accordingly I wish to speak first in order to give
them due weight. So you will allow me to speak first in this meeting
where I see so many notable persons, such as the present se&ntilde;or
capitan, the former capitan; my distinguished friend, Don Valentin, a
former capitan; the friend of my infancy, Don Julio; our celebrated
captain of cuadrilleros, Don Melchor; and many other personages, whom,
for the sake of brevity, I must omit to enumerate&mdash;all of whom you
see present here. I beg of you that I may be allowed a few words before
any one else speaks. Have I the good fortune to see my humble request
granted by the meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here the orator with a faint smile inclined his head
respectfully. &ldquo;Go on, you have our undivided attention!&rdquo;
said the notables alluded to and some others who considered Capitan
Basilio a great orator. The elders coughed in a satisfied way and
rubbed their hands. After wiping the perspiration from his brow with a
silk handkerchief, he then proceeded:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now that you have been so kind and complaisant
with my humble self as to grant me the use of a few words before any
one else of those here present, I shall take advantage of this
permission, so generously granted, and shall talk. In imagination I
fancy myself in the midst of the august Roman senate, <i>senatus
populusque romanus</i>, as was said in those happy days which,
unfortunately for humanity, will nevermore return. I propose to the
<i>Patres Conscripti</i>, as the learned Cicero would say if he were in
my place, I propose, in view of the short time left, and time is money
as Solomon said, that concerning this important matter each one set
forth his opinion clearly, briefly, and simply.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Satisfied with himself and flattered by the attention in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3763" href="#xd24e3763" name=
"xd24e3763">140</a>]</span>the hall, the orator took his seat, not
without first casting a glance of superiority toward Ibarra, who was
seated in a corner, and a significant look at his friends as if to say,
&ldquo;Aha! Haven&rsquo;t I spoken well?&rdquo; His friends reflected
both of these expressions by staring at the youths as though to make
them die of envy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now any one may speak who wishes
that&mdash;ahem!&rdquo; began the gobernadorcillo, but a repetition of
the cough and sighs cut short the phrase.</p>
<p class="par">To judge from the silence, no one wished to consider
himself called upon as one of the Conscript Fathers, since no one rose.
Then Don Filipo seized the opportunity and rose to speak. The
conservatives winked and made significant signs to each other.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I rise, gentlemen, to present my estimate of
expenses for the fiesta,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t allow
it,&rdquo; commented a consumptive old man, who was an irreconcilable
conservative.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll vote against it,&rdquo; corroborated
others. &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Filipo, repressing a
smile, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet made known the plan which we, <i>the
younger men</i>, bring here. We feel <i>sure</i> that this great plan
will be preferred by all over any other that our opponents think of or
are capable of conceiving.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This presumptuous exordium so thoroughly irritated the
minds of the conservatives that they swore in their hearts to offer
determined opposition.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We have estimated three thousand five hundred
pesos for the expenses,&rdquo; went on Don Filipo. &ldquo;Now then,
with such a sum we shall be able to celebrate a fiesta that will
eclipse in magnificence any that has been seen up to this time in our
own or neighboring provinces.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; coughed some doubters. &ldquo;The
town of A&mdash;&mdash; has five thousand, B&mdash;&mdash; has four
thousand, ahem! Humbug!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen to me, gentlemen, and I&rsquo;ll convince
you,&rdquo; continued the unterrified speaker. &ldquo;I propose that we
erect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3787" href="#xd24e3787" name=
"xd24e3787">141</a>]</span>a theater in the middle of the plaza, to
cost one hundred and fifty pesos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be enough! It&rsquo;ll take one
hundred and sixty,&rdquo; objected a confirmed conservative.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Write it down, Se&ntilde;or Director, two hundred
pesos for the theater,&rdquo; said Don Filipo. &ldquo;I further propose
that we contract with a troupe of comedians from Tondo for seven
performances on seven successive nights. Seven performances at two
hundred pesos a night make fourteen hundred pesos. Write down fourteen
hundred pesos, Se&ntilde;or Director!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Both the elders and the youths stared in amazement. Only
those in the secret gave no sign.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I propose besides that we have magnificent
fireworks; no little lights and pin-wheels such as please children and
old maids, nothing of the sort. We want big bombs and immense rockets.
I propose two hundred big bombs at two pesos each and two hundred
rockets at the same price. We&rsquo;ll have them made by the
pyrotechnists of Malabon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted an old man, &ldquo;a two-peso
bomb doesn&rsquo;t frighten or deafen me! They ought to be three-peso
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Write down one thousand pesos for two hundred
bombs and two hundred rockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The conservatives could no longer restrain themselves.
Some of them rose and began to whisper together. &ldquo;Moreover, in
order that our visitors may see that we are a liberal people and have
plenty of money,&rdquo; continued the speaker, raising his voice and
casting a rapid glance at the whispering group of elders, &ldquo;I
propose: first, four <i>hermanos mayores</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e3806src" href="#xd24e3806" name="xd24e3806src">3</a> for the two
days of the fiesta; and second, that each day there be thrown into the
lake two hundred fried chickens, one hundred stuffed capons, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3815" href="#xd24e3815" name=
"xd24e3815">142</a>]</span>forty roast pigs, as did Sylla, a
contemporary of that Cicero, of whom Capitan Basilio just
spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, like Sylla,&rdquo; repeated the
flattered Capitan Basilio.</p>
<p class="par">The surprise steadily increased.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since many rich people will attend and each one
will bring thousands of pesos, his best game-cocks, and his
playing-cards, I propose that the cockpit run for fifteen days and that
license be granted to open all gambling houses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The youths interrupted him by rising, thinking that he
had gone crazy. The elders were arguing heatedly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And, finally, that we may not neglect the
pleasures of the soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The murmurs and cries which arose all over the hall
drowned his voice out completely, and tumult reigned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; yelled an irreconcilable conservative.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to flatter himself over having run the
whole fiesta, no! Let me speak! Let me speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Filipo has deceived us,&rdquo; cried the
liberals. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll vote against his plan. He has gone over to
the old men. We&rsquo;ll vote against him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The gobernadorcillo, more overwhelmed than ever, did
nothing to restore order, but rather was waiting for them to restore it
themselves.</p>
<p class="par">The captain of the cuadrilleros begged to be heard and
was granted permission to speak, but he did not open his mouth and sat
down again confused and ashamed.</p>
<p class="par">By good fortune, Capitan Valentin, the most moderate of
all the conservatives, arose and said: &ldquo;We cannot agree to what
the teniente-mayor has proposed, as it appears to be exaggerated. So
many bombs and so many nights of theatrical performances can only be
desired by a young man, such as he is, who can spend night after night
sitting up and listening to so many explosions without becoming deaf. I
have consulted the opinion of the sensible persons here and all of them
unanimously disapprove Don Filipo&rsquo;s plan. Is it not so,
gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3841" href=
"#xd24e3841" name="xd24e3841">143</a>]</span>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;
cried the youths and elders with one voice. The youths were delighted
to hear an old man speak so.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are we going to do with four <i>hermanos
mayores?</i>&rdquo; went on the old man. &ldquo;What is the meaning of
those chickens, capons, and roast pigs, thrown into the lake?
&lsquo;Humbug!&rsquo; our neighbors would say. And afterwards we should
have to fast for six months! What have we to do with Sylla and the
Romans? Have they ever invited us to any of their festivities, I
wonder? I, at least, have never received any invitation from them, and
you can all see that I&rsquo;m an old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Romans live in Rome, where the Pope
is,&rdquo; Capitan Basilio prompted him in a low voice. &ldquo;Now I
understand!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man calmly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They would make of their festivals
watch-meetings, and the Pope would order them to throw their food into
the sea so that they might commit no sin. But, in spite of all that,
your plan is inadmissible, impossible, a piece of
foolishness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Being so stoutly opposed, Don Filipo had to withdraw his
proposal. Now that their chief rival had been defeated, even the worst
of the irreconcilable insurgents looked on with calmness while a young
cabeza de barangay asked for the floor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I beg that you excuse the boldness of one so
young as I am in daring to speak before so many persons respected for
their age and prudence and judgment in affairs, but since the eloquent
orator, Capitan Basilio, has requested every one to express his
opinion, let the authoritative words spoken by him excuse my
insignificance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The conservatives nodded their heads with satisfaction,
remarking to one another: &ldquo;This young man talks sensibly.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s modest.&rdquo; &ldquo;He reasons
admirably.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a pity that he doesn&rsquo;t know very well
how to gesticulate,&rdquo; observed Capitan Basilio. &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3861" href=
"#xd24e3861" name="xd24e3861">144</a>]</span>time yet! He hasn&rsquo;t
studied Cicero and he&rsquo;s still a young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I present to you, gentlemen, any program or
plan,&rdquo; the young man continued, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do so with
the thought that you will find it perfect or that you will accept it,
but at the same time that I once more bow to the judgment of all of
you, I wish to prove to our elders that our thoughts are always like
theirs, since we take as our own those ideas so eloquently expressed by
Capitan Basilio.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well spoken! Well spoken!&rdquo; cried the
flattered conservatives. Capitan Basilio made signs to the speaker
showing him how he should stand and how he ought to move his arm. The
only one remaining impassive was the gobernadorcillo, who was either
bewildered or preoccupied; as a matter of fact, he seemed to be both.
The young man went on with more warmth:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My plan, gentlemen, reduces itself to this:
invent new shows that are not common and ordinary, such as we see every
day, and endeavor that the money collected may not leave the town, and
that it be not wasted in smoke, but that it be used in some manner
beneficial to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; assented the youths.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; added the elders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What should we get from a week of comedies, as
the teniente-mayor proposes? What can we learn from the kings of
Bohemia and Granada, who commanded that their daughters&rsquo; heads be
cut off, or that they should be blown from a cannon, which later is
converted into a throne? We are not kings, neither are we barbarians;
we have no cannon, and if we should imitate those people, they would
hang us on Bagumbayan. What are those princesses who mingle in the
battles, scattering thrusts and blows about in combat with princes, or
who wander alone over mountains and through valleys as though seduced
by the <i lang="tl">tikb&aacute;lang</i>? Our nature is to love
sweetness and tenderness in woman, and we would shudder at the thought
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3878" href="#xd24e3878" name=
"xd24e3878">145</a>]</span>taking the blood-stained hand of a maiden,
even when the blood was that of a Moro or a giant, so abhorred by us.
We consider vile the man who raises his hand against a woman, be he
prince or alferez or rude countryman. Would it not be a thousand times
better to give a representation of our own customs in order to correct
our defects and vices and to encourage our better qualities?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
exclaimed some of his faction.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; muttered several old men
thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should never have thought of that,&rdquo;
murmured Capitan Basilio.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But how are you going to do it?&rdquo; asked the
irreconcilable.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very easily,&rdquo; answered the youth. &ldquo;I
have brought here two dramas which I feel sure the good taste and
recognized judgment of the respected elders here assembled will find
very agreeable and entertaining. One is entitled &lsquo;The Election of
the Gobernadorcillo,&rsquo; being a comedy in prose in five acts,
written by one who is here present. The other is in nine acts for two
nights and is a fantastical drama of a satirical nature, entitled
&lsquo;Mariang Makiling,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3891src"
href="#xd24e3891" name="xd24e3891src">4</a> written by one of the best
poets of the province. Seeing that the discussion of preparations for
the fiesta has been postponed and fearing that there would not be time
enough left, we have secretly secured the actors and had them learn
their parts. We hope that with a week of rehearsal they will have
plenty of time to know their parts thoroughly. This, gentlemen, besides
being new, useful, and reasonable, has the great advantage of being
economical; we shall not need costumes, as those of our daily life will
be suitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3897" href=
"#xd24e3897" name="xd24e3897">146</a>]</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for
the theater!&rdquo; shouted Capitan Basilio enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you need cuadrilleros, I&rsquo;ll lend you
mine,&rdquo; cried their captain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I&mdash;and I&mdash;if art old man is
needed&mdash;&rdquo; stammered another one, swelling with pride.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Accepted! Accepted!&rdquo; cried many voices.</p>
<p class="par">Don Filipo became pale with emotion and his eyes filled
with tears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crying from spite,&rdquo; thought the
irreconcilable, so he yelled, &ldquo;Accepted! Accepted without
discussion!&rdquo; Thus satisfied with revenge and the complete defeat
of his rival, this fellow began to praise the young man&rsquo;s
plan.</p>
<p class="par">The latter continued his speech: &ldquo;A fifth of the
money collected may be used to distribute a few prizes, such as to the
best school child, the best herdsman, farmer, fisherman, and so on. We
can arrange for boat races on the river and lake and for horse races on
shore, we can raise greased poles and also have other games in which
our country people can take part. I concede that on account of our
long-established customs we must have some fireworks; wheels and fire
castles are very beautiful and entertaining, but I don&rsquo;t believe
it necessary to have bombs, as the former speaker proposed. Two bands
of music will afford sufficient merriment and thus we shall avoid those
rivalries and quarrels between the poor musicians who come to gladden
our fiesta with their work and who so often behave like fighting-cocks,
afterwards going away poorly paid, underfed, and even bruised and
wounded at times. With the money left over we can begin the erection of
a small building for a schoolhouse, since we can&rsquo;t wait until God
Himself comes down and builds one for us, and it is a sad state of
affairs that while we have a fine cockpit our children study almost in
the curate&rsquo;s stable. Such are the outlines of my plan; the
details can be worked out by all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A murmur of pleasure ran through the hall, as nearly
every one agreed with the youth.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3914" href=
"#xd24e3914" name="xd24e3914">147</a>]</span>Some few muttered,
&ldquo;Innovations! Innovations! When we were young&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s adopt it for the time being and
humiliate that fellow,&rdquo; said others, indicating Don Filipo.</p>
<p class="par">When silence was restored all were agreed. There was
lacking only the approval of the gobernadorcillo. That worthy official
was perspiring and fidgeting about. He rubbed his hand over his
forehead and was at length able to stammer out in a weak voice:
&ldquo;I also agree, but&mdash;ahem!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Every one in the hall listened in silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked Capitan Basilio.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very agreeable,&rdquo; repeated the
gobernadorcillo, &ldquo;that is to say&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
agree&mdash;I mean&mdash;yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; Here he rubbed his eyes
with the back of his hand. &ldquo;But the curate,&rdquo; the poor
fellow went on, &ldquo;the curate wants something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does the curate or do we ourselves pay for this
fiesta? Has he given a cuarto for it?&rdquo; exclaimed a penetrating
voice. All looked toward the place whence these questions came and saw
there the Sage Tasio.</p>
<p class="par">Don Filipo remained motionless with his eyes fixed on
the gobernadorcillo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does the curate want?&rdquo; asked Capitan
Basilio.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, the padre wants six processions, three
sermons, three high masses, and if there is any money left, a comedy
from Tondo with songs in the intermissions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want that,&rdquo; said the
youths and some of the old men.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The curate wants it,&rdquo; repeated the
gobernadorcillo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised him that his wish shall be
carried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then why did you have us assemble
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;F-for the very purpose of telling you
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us so at the
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wanted to tell you, gentlemen, but Capitan
Basilio spoke and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance. The curate must be
obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3949" href=
"#xd24e3949" name="xd24e3949">148</a>]</span>&ldquo;He must be
obeyed,&rdquo; echoed several old men.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He must be obeyed or else the alcalde will put us
all in jail,&rdquo; added several other old men sadly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well then, obey him, and run the fiesta
yourselves,&rdquo; exclaimed the youths, rising. &ldquo;We withdraw our
contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Everything has already been collected,&rdquo;
said the gobernadorcillo.</p>
<p class="par">Don Filipo approached this official and said to him
bitterly, &ldquo;I sacrificed my pride in favor of a good cause; you
are sacrificing your dignity as a man in favor of a bad one, and
you&rsquo;ve spoiled everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra turned to the schoolmaster and asked him,
&ldquo;Is there anything that I can do for you at the capital of the
province? I leave for there immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you some business there?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We have business there!&rdquo; answered Ibarra
mysteriously.</p>
<p class="par">On the way home, when Don Filipo was cursing his bad
luck, old Tasio said to him: &ldquo;The blame is ours! You didn&rsquo;t
protest when they gave you a slave for a chief, and I, fool that I am,
had forgotten it!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e3968" href=

duties are principally rural. Their uniform is a disaster; they go
barefoot; on horseback, they hold the reins in the right hand and a
lance in the left. They are usually good-for-nothing, but to their
credit it must be said that they do no damage. Lacking military
instruction, provided with fire-arms of the first part of the century,
of which one in a hundred might go off in case of need, and for other
arms bolos, talibons, old swords, etc., the cuadrilleros are truly a

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Sisa ran in the direction of her home with her
thoughts in that confused whirl which is produced in our being when, in
the midst of misfortunes, protection and hope alike are gone. It is
then that everything seems to grow dark around us, and, if we do see
some faint light shining from afar, we run toward it, we follow it,
even though an abyss yawns in our path. The mother wanted to save her
sons, and mothers do not ask about means when their children are
concerned. Precipitately she ran, pursued by fear and dark forebodings.
Had they already arrested her son Basilio? Whither had her boy Crispin
fled?</p>
<p class="par">As she approached her little hut she made out above the
garden fence the caps of two soldiers. It would be impossible to tell
what her heart felt: she forgot everything. She was not ignorant of the
boldness of those men, who did not lower their gaze before even the
richest people of the town. What would they do now to her and to her
sons, accused of theft! The civil-guards are not men, they are
civil-guards; they do not listen to supplications and they are
accustomed to see tears.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa instinctively raised her eyes toward the sky, that
sky which smiled with brilliance indescribable, and in whose
transparent blue floated some little fleecy clouds. She stopped to
control the trembling that had seized her whole body. The soldiers were
leaving the house and were alone, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e3991" href="#xd24e3991" name="xd24e3991">150</a>]</span>as they
had arrested nothing more than the hen which Sisa had been fattening.
She breathed more freely and took heart again. &ldquo;How good they are
and what kind hearts they have!&rdquo; she murmured, almost weeping
with joy. Had the soldiers burned her house but left her sons at
liberty she would have heaped blessings upon them! She again looked
gratefully toward the sky through which a flock of herons, those light
clouds in the skies of the Philippines, were cutting their path, and
with restored confidence she continued on her way. As she approached
those fearful men she threw her glances in every direction as if
unconcerned and pretended not to see her hen, which was cackling for
help. Scarcely had she passed them when she wanted to run, but prudence
restrained her steps.</p>
<p class="par">She had not gone far when she heard herself called by an
imperious voice. Shuddering, she pretended not to hear, and continued
on her way. They called her again, this time with a yell and an
insulting epithet. She turned toward them, pale and trembling in spite
of herself. One of them beckoned to her. Mechanically Sisa approached
them, her tongue paralyzed with fear and her throat parched.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell us the truth or we&rsquo;ll tie you to that
tree and shoot you,&rdquo; said one of them in a threatening tone.</p>
<p class="par">The woman stared at the tree.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the mother of the thieves,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother of the thieves!&rdquo; repeated Sisa
mechanically.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the money your sons brought you
last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! The money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it or it&rsquo;ll be the worse
for you,&rdquo; added the other. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to arrest your
sons, and the older has escaped from us. Where have you hidden the
younger?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Upon hearing this Sisa breathed more freely and
answered, &ldquo;Sir, it has been many days since I&rsquo;ve seen
Crispin. I expected to see him this morning at the convento, but there
they only told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4013" href=
"#xd24e4013" name="xd24e4013">151</a>]</span>The two soldiers exchanged
significant glances. &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; exclaimed one of them.
&ldquo;Give us the money and we&rsquo;ll leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; begged the unfortunate woman,
&ldquo;my sons wouldn&rsquo;t steal even though they were starving, for
we are used to that kind of suffering. Basilio didn&rsquo;t bring me a
single cuarto. Search the whole house and if you find even a real, do
with us what you will. Not all of us poor folks are thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; ordered the soldier slowly, as
he fixed his gaze on Sisa&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;come with us. Your sons
will show up and try to get rid of the money they stole. Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&mdash;go with you?&rdquo; murmured the woman,
as she stepped backward and gazed fearfully at their uniforms.
&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, have pity on me!&rdquo; she begged, almost on
her knees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very poor, so I&rsquo;ve neither gold nor
jewels to offer you. The only thing I had you&rsquo;ve already taken,
and that is the hen which I was thinking of selling. Take everything
that you find in the house, but leave me here in peace, leave me here
to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go ahead! You&rsquo;re got to go, and if you
don&rsquo;t move along willingly, we&rsquo;ll tie you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sisa broke out into bitter weeping, but those men were
inflexible. &ldquo;At least, let me go ahead of you some
distance,&rdquo; she begged, when she felt them take hold of her
brutally and push her along.</p>
<p class="par">The soldiers seemed to be somewhat affected and, after
whispering apart, one of them said: &ldquo;All right, since from here
until we get into the town, you might be able to escape, you&rsquo;ll
walk between us. Once there you may walk ahead twenty paces, but take
care that you don&rsquo;t delay and that you don&rsquo;t go into any
shop, and don&rsquo;t stop. Go ahead, quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Vain were her supplications and arguments, useless her
promises. The soldiers said that they had already compromised
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4032" href="#xd24e4032" name=
"xd24e4032">152</a>]</span>themselves by having conceded too much. Upon
finding herself between them she felt as if she would die of shame. No
one indeed was coming along the road, but how about the air and the
light of day? True shame encounters eyes everywhere. She covered her
face with her pa&ntilde;uelo and walked along blindly, weeping in
silence at her disgrace. She had felt misery and knew what it was to be
abandoned by every one, even her own husband, but until now she had
considered herself honored and respected: up to this time she had
looked with compassion on those boldly dressed women whom the town knew
as the concubines of the soldiers. Now it seemed to her that she had
fallen even a step lower than they in the social scale.</p>
<p class="par">The sound of hoofs was heard, proceeding from a small
train of men and women mounted on poor nags, each between two baskets
hung over the back of his mount; it was a party carrying fish to the
interior towns. Some of them on passing her hut had often asked for a
drink of water and had presented her with some fishes. Now as they
passed her they seemed to beat and trample upon her while their
compassionate or disdainful looks penetrated through her pa&ntilde;uelo
and stung her face. When these travelers had finally passed she sighed
and raised the pa&ntilde;uelo an instant to see how far she still was
from the town. There yet remained a few telegraph poles to be passed
before reaching the <i>bantayan</i>, or little watch-house, at the
entrance to the town. Never had that distance seemed so great to
her.</p>
<p class="par">Beside the road there grew a leafy bamboo thicket in
whose shade she had rested at other times, and where her lover had
talked so sweetly as he helped her carry her basket of fruit and
vegetables. Alas, all that was past, like a dream! The lover had become
her husband and a cabeza de barangay, and then trouble had commenced to
knock at her door. As the sun was beginning to shine hotly, the
soldiers asked her if she did not want to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e4041" href="#xd24e4041" name="xd24e4041">153</a>]</span>rest
there. &ldquo;Thanks, no!&rdquo; was the horrified woman&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<p class="par">Real terror seized her when they neared the town. She
threw her anguished gaze in all directions, but no refuge offered
itself, only wide rice-fields, a small irrigating ditch, and some
stunted trees; there was not a cliff or even a rock upon which she
might dash herself to pieces! Now she regretted that she had come so
far with the soldiers; she longed for the deep river that flowed by her
hut, whose high and rock-strewn banks would have offered such a sweet
death. But again the thought of her sons, especially of Crispin, of
whose fate she was still ignorant, lightened the darkness of her night,
and she was able to murmur resignedly,
&ldquo;Afterwards&mdash;afterwards&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go and live in the
depths of the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Drying her eyes and trying to look calm, she turned to
her guards and said in a low voice, with an indefinable accent that was
a complaint and a lament, a prayer and a reproach, sorrow condensed
into sound, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in the town.&rdquo; Even the
soldiers seemed touched as they answered her with a gesture. She
struggled to affect a calm bearing while she went forward quickly.</p>
<p class="par">At that moment the church bells began to peal out,
announcing the end of the high mass. Sisa hurried her steps so as to
avoid, if possible, meeting the people who were coming out, but in
vain, for no means offered to escape encountering them. With a bitter
smile she saluted two of her acquaintances, who merely turned inquiring
glances upon her, so that to avoid further mortification she fixed her
gaze on the ground, and yet, strange to say, she stumbled over the
stones in the road! Upon seeing her, people paused for a moment and
conversed among themselves as they gazed at her, all of which she saw
and felt in spite of her downcast eyes.</p>
<p class="par">She heard the shameless tones of a woman who asked from
behind at the top of her voice, &ldquo;Where did you catch her? And the
money?&rdquo; It was a woman without <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e4051" href="#xd24e4051" name="xd24e4051">154</a>]</span>a tapis,
or tunic, dressed in a green and yellow skirt and a camisa of blue
gauze, easily recognizable from her costume as a <i>querida</i> of the
soldiery. Sisa felt as if she had received a slap in the face, for that
woman had exposed her before the crowd. She raised her eyes for a
moment to get her fill of scorn and hate, but saw the people far, far
away. Yet she felt the chill of their stares and heard their whispers
as she moved over the ground almost without knowing that she touched
it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Eh, this way!&rdquo; a guard called to her. Like
an automaton whose mechanism is breaking, she whirled about rapidly on
her heels, then without seeing or thinking of anything ran to hide
herself. She made out a door where a sentinel stood and tried to enter
it, but a still more imperious voice called her aside. With wavering
steps she sought the direction of that voice, then felt herself pushed
along by the shoulders; she shut her eyes, took a couple of steps, and
lacking further strength, let herself fall to the ground, first on her
knees and then in a sitting posture. Dry and voiceless sobs shook her
frame convulsively.</p>
<p class="par">Now she was in the barracks among the soldiers, women,
hogs, and chickens. Some of the men were sewing at their clothes while
their thighs furnished pillows for their <i>queridas</i>, who were
reclining on benches, smoking and gazing wearily at the ceiling. Other
women were helping some of the men clean their ornaments and arms,
humming doubtful songs the while.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems that the chicks have escaped, for
you&rsquo;ve brought only the old hen!&rdquo; commented one woman to
the new arrivals,&mdash;whether alluding to Sisa or the still clucking
hen is not certain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, the hen is always worth more than the
chicks,&rdquo; Sisa herself answered when she observed that the
soldiers were silent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the sergeant?&rdquo; asked one of
the guards in a disgusted tone. &ldquo;Has report been made to the
alferez yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4071" href=
"#xd24e4071" name="xd24e4071">155</a>]</span>A general shrugging of
shoulders was his answer, for no one was going to trouble himself
inquiring about the fate of a poor woman.</p>
<p class="par">There Sisa spent two hours in a state of semi-idiocy,
huddled in a corner with her head hidden in her arms and her hair
falling down in disorder. At noon the alferez was informed, and the
first thing that he did was to discredit the curate&rsquo;s
accusation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah! Tricks of that rascally friar,&rdquo; he
commented, as he ordered that the woman be released and that no one
should pay any attention to the matter. &ldquo;If he wants to get back
what he&rsquo;s lost, let him ask <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony or complain to the nuncio. Out with
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Consequently, Sisa was ejected from the barracks almost
violently, as she did not try to move herself. Finding herself in the
street, she instinctively started to hurry toward her house, with her
head bared, her hair disheveled, and her gaze fixed on the distant
horizon. The sun burned in its zenith with never a cloud to shade its
flashing disk; the wind shook the leaves of the trees lightly along the
dry road, while no bird dared stir from the shade of their
branches.</p>
<p class="par">At last Sisa reached her hut and entered it in silence,
She walked all about it and ran in and out for a time. Then she hurried
to old Tasio&rsquo;s house and knocked at the door, but he was not at
home. The unhappy woman then returned to her hut and began to call
loudly for Basilio and Crispin, stopping every few minutes to listen
attentively. Her voice came back in an echo, for the soft murmur of the
water in the neighboring river and the rustling of the bamboo leaves
were the only sounds that broke the stillness. She called again and
again as she climbed the low cliffs, or went down into a gully, or
descended to the river. Her eyes rolled about with a sinister
expression, now flashing up with brilliant gleams, now becoming
obscured like the sky on a stormy night; it might be said that the
light of reason was flickering and about to be extinguished.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4085" href=
"#xd24e4085" name="xd24e4085">156</a>]</span>Again returning to her
hut, she sat down on the mat where she had lain the night before.
Raising her eyes, she saw a twisted remnant from Basilio&rsquo;s camisa
at the end of the bamboo post in the <i>dinding</i>, or wall, that
overlooked the precipice. She seized and examined it in the sunlight.
There were blood stains on it, but Sisa hardly saw them, for she went
outside and continued to raise and lower it before her eyes to examine
it in the burning sunlight. The light was failing and everything
beginning to grow dark around her. She gazed wide-eyed and unblinkingly
straight at the sun.</p>
<p class="par">Still wandering about here and there, crying and
wailing, she would have frightened any listener, for her voice now
uttered rare notes such as are not often produced in the human throat.
In a night of roaring tempest, when the whirling winds beat with
invisible wings against the crowding shadows that ride upon it, if you
should find yourself in a solitary and ruined building, you would hear
moans and sighs which you might suppose to be the soughing of the wind
as it beats on the high towers and moldering walls to fill you with
terror and make you shudder in spite of yourself; as mournful as those
unknown sounds of the dark night when the tempest roars were the
accents of that mother. In this condition night came upon her. Perhaps
Heaven had granted some hours of sleep while the invisible wing of an
angel, brushing over her pallid countenance, might wipe out the sorrows
from her memory; perhaps such suffering was too great for weak human
endurance, and Providence had intervened with its sweet remedy,
forgetfulness. However that may be, the next day Sisa wandered about
smiling, singing, and talking with all the creatures of wood and field.

<h2 class="main">Lights and Shadows</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Three days have passed since the events narrated,
three days which the town of San Diego has devoted to making
preparations for the fiesta, commenting and murmuring at the same time.
While all were enjoying the prospect of the pleasures to come, some
spoke ill of the gobernadorcillo, others of the teniente-mayor, others
of the young men, and there were not lacking those who blamed everybody
for everything.</p>
<p class="par">There was a great deal of comment on the arrival of
Maria Clara, accompanied by her Aunt Isabel. All rejoiced over it
because they loved her and admired her beauty, while at the same time
they wondered at the change that had come over Padre Salvi. &ldquo;He
often becomes inattentive during the holy services, nor does he talk
much with us, and he is thinner and more taciturn than usual,&rdquo;
commented his penitents. The cook noticed him getting thinner and
thinner by minutes and complained of the little honor that was done to
his dishes. But that which caused the most comment among the people was
the fact that in the convento were to be seen more than two lights
burning during the evening while Padre Salvi was on a visit to a
private dwelling&mdash;the home of Maria Clara! The pious women crossed
themselves but continued their comments.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra had telegraphed from the capital of the province
welcoming Aunt Isabel and her niece, but had failed to explain the
reason for his absence. Many thought him a prisoner on account of his
treatment of Padre Salvi on the afternoon of All Saints, but the
comments reached a climax when, on the evening of the third day, they
saw him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4104" href="#xd24e4104"
name="xd24e4104">158</a>]</span>alight before the home of his
fianc&eacute;e and extend a polite greeting to the priest, who was just
entering the same house.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa and her sons were forgotten by all.</p>
<p class="par">If we should now go into the home of Maria Clara, a
beautiful nest set among trees of orange and ilang-ilang, we should
surprise the two young people at a window overlooking the lake,
shadowed by flowers and climbing vines which exhaled a delicate
perfume. Their lips murmured words softer than the rustling of the
leaves and sweeter than the aromatic odors that floated through the
garden. It was the hour when the sirens of the lake take advantage of
the fast falling twilight to show their merry heads above the waves to
gaze upon the setting sun and sing it to rest. It is said that their
eyes and hair are blue, and that they are crowned with white and red
water plants; that at times the foam reveals their shapely forms,
whiter than the foam itself, and that when night descends completely
they begin their divine sports, playing mysterious airs like those of
&AElig;olian harps. But let us turn to our young people and listen to
the end of their conversation. Ibarra was speaking to Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tomorrow before daybreak your wish shall be
fulfilled. I&rsquo;ll arrange everything tonight so that nothing will
be lacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll write to my girl friends to come.
But arrange it so that the curate won&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because he seems to be watching me. His deep,
gloomy eyes trouble me, and when he fixes them on me I&rsquo;m afraid.
When he talks to me, his voice&mdash;oh, he speaks of such odd, such
strange, such incomprehensible things! He asked me once if I have ever
dreamed of letters from my mother. I really believe that he is
half-crazy. My friend Sinang and my foster-sister, Andeng, say that he
is somewhat touched, because he neither eats nor bathes and lives in
darkness. See to it that he does not come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4120" href=
"#xd24e4120" name="xd24e4120">159</a>]</span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do
otherwise than invite him,&rdquo; answered Ibarra thoughtfully.
&ldquo;The customs of the country require it. He is in your house and,
besides, he has conducted himself nobly toward me. When the alcalde
consulted him about the business of which I&rsquo;ve told you, he had
only praises for me and didn&rsquo;t try to put the least obstacle in
the way. But I see that you&rsquo;re serious about it, so cease
worrying, for he won&rsquo;t go in the same boat with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Light footsteps were heard. It was the curate, who
approached with a forced smile on his lips. &ldquo;The wind is
chilly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and when one catches cold one generally
doesn&rsquo;t get rid of it until the hot weather. Aren&rsquo;t you
afraid of catching cold?&rdquo; His voice trembled and his eyes were
turned toward the distant horizon, away from the young people.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, we rather find the night pleasant and the
breeze delicious,&rdquo; answered Ibarra. &ldquo;During these months we
have our autumn and our spring. Some leaves fall, but the flowers are
always in bloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Salvi sighed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I think the union of these two seasons beautiful,
with no cold winter intervening,&rdquo; continued Ibarra. &ldquo;In
February the buds on the trees will burst open and in March we&rsquo;ll
have the ripe fruit. When the hot month&rsquo;s come we shall go
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Salvi smiled and began to talk of commonplace
things, of the weather, of the town, and of the fiesta. Maria Clara
slipped away on some pretext.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since we are talking of fiestas, allow me to
invite you to the one that we are going to celebrate tomorrow. It is to
be a picnic in the woods, which we and our friends are going to hold
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where will it be held?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The young women wish to hold it by the brook in
the neighboring wood, near to the old balete, so we shall rise early to
avoid the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The priest thought a moment and then answered:
&ldquo;The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4140" href="#xd24e4140"
name="xd24e4140">160</a>]</span>invitation is very tempting and I
accept it to prove to you that I hold no rancor against you. But I
shall have to go late, after I&rsquo;ve attended to my duties. Happy
are you who are free, entirely free.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A few moments later Ibarra left in order to look after
the arrangements for the picnic on the next day. The night was dark and
in the street some one approached and saluted him respectfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir, you don&rsquo;t know my name,&rdquo;
answered the unknown, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you two
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because nowhere has any pity been shown me and
they say that I&rsquo;m an outlaw, sir. But I&rsquo;ve lost my two
sons, my wife is insane, and every one says that I deserve what has
happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra looked at the man critically as he asked,
&ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To beg for your pity upon my wife and
sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop now,&rdquo; replied Ibarra.
&ldquo;If you wish to come, you can tell me as we go along what has
happened to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The man thanked him, and the two quickly disappeared in
the shadows along the dimly lighted street. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The stars still glittered in the sapphire arch of
heaven and the birds were still sleeping among the branches when a
merry party, lighted by torches of resin, commonly called
<i>huepes</i>, made its way through the streets toward the lake. There
were five girls, who walked along rapidly with hands clasped or arms
encircling one another&rsquo;s waists, followed by some old women and
by servants who were carrying gracefully on their heads baskets of food
and dishes. Looking upon the laughing and hopeful countenances of the
young women and watching the wind blow about their abundant black hair
and the wide folds of their garments, we might have taken them for
goddesses of the night fleeing from the day, did we not know that they
were Maria Clara and her four friends, the merry Sinang, the grave
Victoria, the beautiful Iday, and the thoughtful Neneng of modest and
timid beauty. They were conversing in a lively manner, laughing and
pinching one another, whispering in one another&rsquo;s ears and then
breaking out into loud laughter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wake up the people who are still
asleep,&rdquo; Aunt Isabel scolded. &ldquo;When we were young, we
didn&rsquo;t make so much disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Neither would you get up so early nor would the
old folks have been such sleepy-heads,&rdquo; retorted little
Sinang.</p>
<p class="par">They were silent for a short time, then tried to talk in
low tones, but soon forgot themselves and again filled the street with
their fresh young voices.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Behave as if you were displeased and don&rsquo;t
talk to him,&rdquo; Sinang was advising Maria Clara. &ldquo;Scold him
so he won&rsquo;t get into bad habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4182" href=
"#xd24e4182" name="xd24e4182">162</a>]</span> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so
exacting,&rdquo; objected Iday.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be exacting! Don&rsquo;t be foolish! He must be
made to obey while he&rsquo;s only engaged, for after he&rsquo;s your
husband he&rsquo;ll do as he pleases,&rdquo; counseled little
Sinang.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you know about that, child?&rdquo; her
cousin Victoria corrected her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sst! Keep quiet, for here they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A group of young men, lighting their way with large
bamboo torches, now came up, marching gravely along to the sound of a
guitar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It sounds like a beggar&rsquo;s guitar,&rdquo;
laughed Sinang. When the two parties met it was the women who
maintained a serious and formal attitude, just as if they had never
known how to laugh, while on the other hand the men talked and laughed,
asking six questions to get half an answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is the lake calm? Do you think we&rsquo;ll have
good weather?&rdquo; asked the mothers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, ladies, I know how to
swim well,&rdquo; answered a tall, thin, emaciated youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We ought to have heard mass first,&rdquo; sighed
Aunt Isabel, clasping her hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s yet time, ma&rsquo;am. Albino has
been a theological student in his day and can say it in the
boat,&rdquo; remarked another youth, pointing to the tall, thin one who
had first spoken. The latter, who had a clownish countenance, threw
himself into an attitude of contrition, caricaturing Padre Salvi.
Ibarra, though he maintained his serious demeanor, also joined in the
merriment.</p>
<p class="par">When they arrived at the beach, there involuntarily
escaped from the women exclamations of surprise and pleasure at the
sight of two large bankas fastened together and picturesquely adorned
with garlands of flowers, leaves, and ruined cotton of many colors.
Little paper lanterns hung from an improvised canopy amid flowers and
fruits. Comfortable seats with rugs and cushions for the women had been
provided by Ibarra. Even the paddles and oars <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4205" href="#xd24e4205" name=
"xd24e4205">163</a>]</span>were decorated, while in the more profusely
decorated banka were a harp, guitars, accordions, and a trumpet made
from a carabao horn. In the other banka fires burned on the clay
<i>kalanes</i> for preparing refreshments of tea, coffee, and
<i>salabat</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In this boat here the women, and in the other
there the men,&rdquo; ordered the mothers upon embarking. &ldquo;Keep
quiet! Don&rsquo;t move about so or we&rsquo;ll be upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cross yourself first,&rdquo; advised Aunt Isabel,
setting the example.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are we to be here all alone?&rdquo; asked Sinang
with a grimace. &ldquo;Ourselves alone?&rdquo; This question was
opportunely answered by a pinch from her mother.</p>
<p class="par">As the boats moved slowly away from the shore, the light
of the lanterns was reflected in the calm waters of the lake, while in
the eastern sky the first tints of dawn were just beginning to appear.
A deep silence reigned over the party after the division established by
the mothers, for the young people seemed to have given themselves up to
meditation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said Albino, the ex-theological
student, in a loud tone to another youth. &ldquo;Keep your foot tight
on the plug under you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It might come out and let the water in. This
banka has a lot of holes in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re going to sink!&rdquo; cried the
frightened women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, ladies,&rdquo; the
ex-theological student reassured them to calm their fears. &ldquo;The
banka you are in is safe. It has only five holes in it and they
aren&rsquo;t large.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Five holes! <i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> Do you want to
drown us?&rdquo; exclaimed the horrified women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not more than five, ladies, and only about so
large,&rdquo; the ex-theological student assured them, indicating the
circle formed with his index finger and thumb. &ldquo;Press hard on the
plugs so that they won&rsquo;t come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Mar&iacute;a Sant&iacute;sima!</i> The
water&rsquo;s coming in,&rdquo; cried an old woman who felt herself
already getting wet.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4245" href=
"#xd24e4245" name="xd24e4245">164</a>]</span>There now arose a small
tumult; some screamed, while others thought of jumping into the
water.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Press hard on the plugs there!&rdquo; repeated
Albino, pointing toward the place where the girls were.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where, where? <i>Di&oacute;s!</i> We don&rsquo;t
know how! For pity&rsquo;s sake come here, for we don&rsquo;t know
how!&rdquo; begged the frightened women.</p>
<p class="par">It was accordingly necessary for five of the young men
to get over into the other banka to calm the terrified mothers. But by
some strange chance it seemed that there w, as danger by the side of
each of the <i>dalagas</i>; all the old ladies together did not have a
single dangerous hole near them! Still more strange it was that Ibarra
had to be seated by the side of Maria Clara, Albino beside Victoria,
and so on. Quiet was restored among the solicitous mothers but not in
the circle of the young people.</p>
<p class="par">As the water was perfectly still, the fish-corrals not
far away, and the hour yet early, it was decided to abandon the oars so
that all might partake of some refreshment. Dawn had now come, so the
lanterns were extinguished.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to compare with
<i>salabat</i>, drunk in the morning before going to mass,&rdquo; said
Capitana Tika, mother of the merry Sinang. &ldquo;Drink some
<i>salabat</i> and eat a rice-cake, Albino, and you&rsquo;ll see that
even you will want to pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo;
answered the youth addressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of confessing
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sinang, &ldquo;drink some coffee
to bring merry thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will, at once, because I feel a trifle
sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; advised Aunt Isabel.
&ldquo;Drink some tea and eat a few crackers. They say that tea calms
one&rsquo;s thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll also take some tea and
crackers,&rdquo; answered the complaisant youth, &ldquo;since
fortunately none of these drinks is Catholicism.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, can you&mdash;&rdquo; Victoria began.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4283" href=
"#xd24e4283" name="xd24e4283">165</a>]</span> &ldquo;Drink some
chocolate also? Well, I guess so, since breakfast is not so far
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The morning was beautiful. The water began to gleam with
the light reflected from the sky with such clearness that every object
stood revealed without producing a shadow, a bright, fresh clearness
permeated with color, such as we get a hint of in some marine
paintings. All were now merry as they breathed in the light breeze that
began to arise. Even the mothers, so full of cautions and warnings, now
laughed and joked among themselves.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; one old woman was saying
to Capitana Tika, &ldquo;do you remember the time we went to bathe in
the river, before we were married? In little boats made from
banana-stalks there drifted down with the current fruits of many kinds
and fragrant flowers. The little boats had banners on them and each of
us could see her name on one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And when we were on our way back home?&rdquo;
added another, without letting her go on. &ldquo;We found the bamboo
bridges destroyed and so we had to wade the brooks. The
rascals!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, I know that I chose rather to let the
borders of my skirt get wet than to uncover my feet,&rdquo; said
Capitana Tika, &ldquo;for I knew that in the thickets on the bank there
were eyes watching us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Some of the girls who heard these reminiscences winked
and smiled, while the others were so occupied with their own
conversations that they took no notice.</p>
<p class="par">One man alone, he who performed the duty of pilot,
remained silent and removed from all the merriment. He was a youth of
athletic build and striking features, with large, sad eyes and
compressed lips. His black hair, long and unkempt, fell over a stout
neck. A dark striped shirt afforded a suggestion through its folds of
the powerful muscles that enabled the vigorous arms to handle as if it
were a pen the wide and unwieldy paddle which&rsquo; served as a rudder
for steering the two bankas.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4299" href=
"#xd24e4299" name="xd24e4299">166</a>]</span>Maria Clara had more than
once caught him looking at her, but on such occasions he had quickly
turned his gaze toward the distant mountain or the shore. The young
woman was moved with pity at his loneliness and offered him some
crackers. The pilot gave her a surprised stare, which, however, lasted
for only a second. He took a cracker and thanked her briefly in a
scarcely audible voice. After this no one paid any more attention to
him. The sallies and merry laughter of the young folks caused not the
slightest movement in the muscles of his face. Even the merry Sinang
did not make him smile when she received pinchings that caused her to
wrinkle up her eyebrows for an instant, only to return to her former
merry mood.</p>
<p class="par">The lunch over, they proceeded on their way toward the
fish-corrals, of which there were two situated near each other, both
belonging to Capitan Tiago. From afar were to be seen some herons
perched in contemplative attitude on the tops of the bamboo posts,
while a number of white birds, which the Tagalogs call <i>kalaway</i>,
flew about in different directions, skimming the water with their wings
and filling the air with shrill cries. At the approach of the bankas
the herons took to flight, and Maria Clara followed them with her gaze
as they flew in the direction of the neighboring mountain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do those birds build their nests on the
mountain?&rdquo; she asked the pilot, not so much from a desire to know
as for the purpose of making him talk.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Probably they do, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;but no one up to this time has ever seen their
nests.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they have nests?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose they must have them, otherwise they
would be very unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara did not notice the tone of sadness with
which he uttered these words. &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is said, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; answered the
strange youth, &ldquo;that the nests of those birds are invisible and
that they have the power of rendering invisible any one who possesses
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4319" href="#xd24e4319" name=
"xd24e4319">167</a>]</span>one of them. Just as the soul can only be
seen in the pure mirror of the eyes, so also in the mirror of the water
alone can their nests be looked upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara became sad and thoughtful. Meanwhile, they
had reached the first fish-corral and an aged boatman tied the craft to
a post.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; called Aunt Isabel to the son of the
fisherman, who was getting ready to climb upon the platform of the
corral with his <i>panalok</i>, or fish-net fastened on the end of a
stout bamboo pole. &ldquo;We must get the <i>sinigang</i> ready so that
the fish may pass at once from the water into the soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Kind Aunt Isabel!&rdquo; exclaimed the
ex-theological student. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want the fish to miss
the water for an instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Andeng, Maria Clara&rsquo;s foster-sister, in spite of
her carefree and happy face, enjoyed the reputation of being an
excellent cook, so she set about preparing a soup of rice and
vegetables, helped and hindered by some of the young men, eager perhaps
to win her favor. The other young women all busied themselves in
cutting up and washing the vegetables.</p>
<p class="par">In order to divert the impatience of those who were
waiting to see the fishes taken alive and wriggling from their prison,
the beautiful Iday got out the harp, for Iday not only played well on
that instrument, but, besides, she had very pretty fingers. The young
people applauded and Maria Clara kissed her, for the harp is the most
popular instrument in that province, and was especially suited to this
occasion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sing the hymn about marriage,&rdquo; begged the
old women. The men protested and Victoria, who had a fine voice,
complained of hoarseness. The &ldquo;Hymn of Marriage&rdquo; is a
beautiful Tagalog chant in which are set forth the cares and sorrows of
the married state, yet not passing over its joys.</p>
<p class="par">They then asked Maria Clara to sing, but she protested
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4341" href="#xd24e4341" name=
"xd24e4341">168</a>]</span>that all her songs were sad ones. This
protest, however, was overruled so she held back no longer. Taking the
harp, she played a short prelude and then sang in a harmonious and
vibrating voice full of feeling:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Sweet are the hours in one&rsquo;s native land,</p>
<p class="line xd24e788">Where all is dear the sunbeams bless;</p>
<p class="line">Life-giving breezes sweep the strand,</p>
<p class="line xd24e788">And death is soften&rsquo;d by love&rsquo;s
caress.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Warm kisses play on mother&rsquo;s lips,</p>
<p class="line xd24e788">On her fond, tender breast awaking;</p>
<p class="line">When round her neck the soft arm slips,</p>
<p class="line xd24e788">And bright eyes smile, all love partaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Sweet is death for one&rsquo;s native land,</p>
<p class="line xd24e788">Where all is dear the sunbeams bless;</p>
<p class="line">Dead is the breeze that sweeps the strand,</p>
<p class="line xd24e788">Without a mother, home, or love&rsquo;s
caress.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">The song ceased, the voice died away, the harp
became silent, and they still listened; no one applauded. The young
women felt their eyes fill with tears, and Ibarra seemed to be
unpleasantly affected. The youthful pilot stared motionless into the
distance.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly a thundering roar was heard, such that the
women screamed and covered their ears; it was the ex-theological
student blowing with all the strength of his lungs on the
<i>tambuli</i>, or carabao horn. Laughter and cheerfulness returned
while tear-dimmed eyes brightened. &ldquo;Are you trying to deafen us,
you heretic?&rdquo; cried Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the offender gravely,
&ldquo;I once heard of a poor trumpeter on the banks of the Rhine who,
by playing on his trumpet, won in marriage a rich and noble
maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the trumpeter of
Sackingen!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra, unable to resist taking part in the
renewed merriment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; went on Albino.
&ldquo;Now I want to see if I can&rsquo;t have the same luck.&rdquo; So
saying, he began <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4385" href=
"#xd24e4385" name="xd24e4385">169</a>]</span>to blow with even more
force into the resounding horn, holding it close to the ears of the
girls who looked saddest. As might be expected, a small tumult arose
and the mothers finally reduced him to silence by beating him with
their slippers<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4387src" href="#xd24e4387"
name="xd24e4387src">1</a> and pinching him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My, oh my!&rdquo; he complained as he felt of his
smarting arms, &ldquo;what a distance there is between the Philippines
and the banks of the Rhine! <i>O tempora! O mores!</i> Some are given
honors and others sanbenitos!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All laughed at this, even the grave Victoria, while
Sinang, she of the smiling eyes, whispered to Maria Clara, &ldquo;Happy
girl! I, too, would sing if I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Andeng at length announced that the soup was ready to
receive its guests, so the young fisherman climbed up into the pen
placed at the narrower end of the corral, over which might be written
for the fishes, were they able to read and understand Italian,
&ldquo;<i lang="it">Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch&rsquo;
entrante</i>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4405src" href=
"#xd24e4405" name="xd24e4405src">2</a> for no fish that gets in there
is ever released except by death. This division of the corral encloses
a circular space so arranged that a man can stand on a platform in the
upper part and draw the fish out with a small net.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t get tired fishing there with a
pole and line,&rdquo; commented Sinang, trembling with pleasant
anticipation.</p>
<p class="par">All were now watching and some even began to believe
that they saw the fishes wriggling about in the net and showing their
glittering scales. But when the youth lowered his net not a fish leaped
up.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It must be full,&rdquo; whispered Albino,
&ldquo;for it has been over five days now since it was
visited.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The fisherman drew in his net, but not even a single
little fish adorned it. The water as it fell back in glittering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4419" href="#xd24e4419" name=
"xd24e4419">170</a>]</span>drops reflecting the sunlight seemed to mock
his efforts with a silvery smile. An exclamation of surprise,
displeasure, and disappointment escaped from the lips of all. Again the
youth repeated the operation, but with no better result.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand your business,&rdquo;
said Albino, climbing up into the pen of the corral and taking the net
from the youth&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll see! Andeng, get
the pot ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But apparently Albino did not understand the business
either, for the net again came up empty. All broke out into laughter at
him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make so much noise that the fish can
hear and so not let themselves be caught. This net must be torn.&rdquo;
But on examination all the meshes of the net appeared to be intact.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said Leon, Iday&rsquo;s
sweetheart. He assured himself that the fence was in good condition,
examined the net and being satisfied with it, asked, &ldquo;Are you
sure that it hasn&rsquo;t been visited for five days?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very sure! The last time was on the eve of All
Saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well then, either the lake is enchanted or
I&rsquo;ll draw up something.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Leon then dropped the pole into the water and instantly
astonishment was pictured on his countenance. Silently he looked off
toward the mountain and moved the pole about in the water, then without
raising it murmured in a low voice:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A cayman!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A cayman!&rdquo; repeated everyone, as the word
ran from mouth to mouth in the midst of fright and general
surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; they asked him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say that we&rsquo;re caught a cayman,&rdquo;
Leon assured them, and as he dropped the heavy end of the pole into the
water, he continued: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear that sound?
That&rsquo;s not sand, but a tough hide, the back of a cayman.
Don&rsquo;t you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4444" href=
"#xd24e4444" name="xd24e4444">171</a>]</span>see how the posts shake?
He&rsquo;s pushing against them even though he is all rolled up. Wait,
he&rsquo;s a big one, his body is almost a foot or more
across.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; was the question.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo; prompted some one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Heavens<i>!</i> And who&rsquo;ll catch
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">No one offered to go down into the trap, for the water
was deep.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We ought to tie him to our banka and drag him
along in triumph,&rdquo; suggested Sinang. &ldquo;The idea of his
eating the fish that we were going to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have never yet seen a live cayman,&rdquo;
murmured Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">The pilot arose, picked up a long rope, and climbed
nimbly up on the platform, where Leon made room for him. With the
exception of Maria Clara, no one had taken any notice of him, but now
all admired his shapely figure. To the great surprise of all and in
spite of their cries, he leaped down into the enclosure.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take this knife!&rdquo; called Crisostomo to him,
holding out a wide Toledo blade, but already the water was splashing up
in a thousand jets and the depths closed mysteriously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s, Mar&iacute;a, y
Jos&eacute;</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the old women. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to have an accident!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy, ladies,&rdquo; said the
old boatman, &ldquo;for if there is any one in the province who can do
it, he&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We call him &lsquo;The Pilot&rsquo; and
he&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen, only he doesn&rsquo;t like
the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The water became disturbed, then broke into ripples, the
fence shook; a struggle seemed to be going on in the depths. All were
silent and hardly breathed. Ibarra grasped the handle of the sharp
knife convulsively.</p>
<p class="par">Now the struggle seemed to be at an end and the head of
the youth appeared, to be greeted with joyful cries. The eyes of the
old women filled with tears. The pilot <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e4482" href="#xd24e4482" name="xd24e4482">172</a>]</span>climbed
up with one end of the rope in his hand and once on the platform began
to pull on it. The monster soon appeared above the water with the rope
tied in a double band around its neck and underneath its front legs. It
was a large one, as Leon had said, speckled, and on its back grew the
green moss which is to the caymans what gray hairs are to men. Roaring
like a bull and beating its tail against or catching hold of the sides
of the corral, it opened its huge jaws and showed its long, sharp
teeth. The pilot was hoisting it alone, for no one had thought to
assist him.</p>
<p class="par">Once out of the water and resting on the platform, he
placed his foot upon it and with his strong hands forced its huge jaws
together and tried to tie its snout with stout knots. With a last
effort the reptile arched its body, struck the floor with its powerful
tail, and jerking free, hurled itself with one leap into the water
outside the corral, dragging its captor along with it. A cry of horror
broke from the lips of all. But like a flash of lightning another body
shot into the water so quickly that there was hardly time to realize
that it was Ibarra. Maria Clara did not swoon only for the reason that
the Filipino women do not yet know how to do so.</p>
<p class="par">The anxious watchers saw the water become colored and
dyed with blood. The young fisherman jumped down with his bolo in his
hand and was followed by his father, but they had scarcely disappeared
when Crisostomo and the pilot reappeared clinging to the dead body of
the reptile, which had the whole length of its white belly slit open
and the knife still sticking in its throat.</p>
<p class="par">To describe the joy were impossible, as a dozen arms
reached out to drag the young men from the water. The old women were
beside themselves between laughter and prayers. Andeng forgot that her
<i>sinigang</i> had boiled over three times, spilling the soup and
putting out the fire. The only one who could say nothing was Maria
Clara.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra was uninjured, while the pilot had only a slight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4495" href="#xd24e4495" name=
"xd24e4495">173</a>]</span>scratch on his arm. &ldquo;I owe my life to
you,&rdquo; said the latter to Ibarra, who was wrapping himself up in
blankets and cloths. The pilot&rsquo;s voice seemed to have a note of
sadness in it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are too daring,&rdquo; answered Ibarra.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tempt fate again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you had not come up again&mdash;&rdquo;
murmured the still pale and trembling Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I had not come up and you had followed
me,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, completing the thought in his own way,
&ldquo;in the bottom of the lake, <i>I should still have been with my
family!</i>&rdquo; He had not forgotten that there lay the bones of his
father.</p>
<p class="par">The old women did not want to visit the other corral but
wished to return, saying that the day had begun inauspiciously and that
many more accidents might occur. &ldquo;All because we didn&rsquo;t
hear mass,&rdquo; sighed one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what accident has befallen us, ladies?&rdquo;
asked Ibarra. &ldquo;The cayman seems to have been the only unlucky
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All of which proves,&rdquo; concluded the
ex-student of theology, &ldquo;that in all its sinful life this
unfortunate reptile has never attended mass&mdash;at least, I&rsquo;ve
never seen him among the many other caymans that frequent the
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the boats were turned in the direction of the other
corral and Andeng had to get her <i>sinigang</i> ready again. The day
was now well advanced, with a fresh breeze blowing. The waves curled up
behind the body of the cayman, raising &ldquo;mountains of foam whereon
the smooth, rich sunlight glitters,&rdquo; as the poet says. The music
again resounded; Iday played on the harp, while the men handled the
accordions and guitars with greater or less skill. The prize-winner was
Albino, who actually scratched the instruments, getting out of tune and
losing the time every moment or else forgetting it and changing to
another tune entirely different.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4519" href=
"#xd24e4519" name="xd24e4519">174</a>]</span>The second corral was
visited with some misgivings, as many expected to find there the mate
of the dead cayman, but nature is ever a jester, and the nets came up
full at each haul. Aunt Isabel superintended the sorting of the fish
and ordered that some be left in the trap for decoys. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not lucky to empty the corral completely,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<p class="par">Then they made their way toward the shore near the
forest of old trees that belonged to Ibarra. There in the shade by the
clear waters of the brook, among the flowers, they ate their breakfast
under improvised canopies. The space was filled with music while the
smoke from the fires curled up in slender wreaths. The water bubbled
cheerfully in the hot dishes as though uttering sounds of consolation,
or perchance of sarcasm and irony, to the dead fishes. The body of the
cayman writhed about, sometimes showing its torn white belly and again
its speckled greenish back, while man, Nature&rsquo;s favorite, went on
his way undisturbed by what the Brahmins and vegetarians would call so
many cases of fratricide. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4523"

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">In the Wood</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Early, very early indeed, somewhat differently
from his usual custom, Padre Salvi had celebrated mass and cleansed a
dozen sinful souls in a few moments. Then it seemed that the reading of
some letters which he had received firmly sealed and waxed caused the
worthy curate to lose his appetite, since he allowed his chocolate to
become completely cold.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The padre is getting sick,&rdquo; commented the
cook while preparing another cup. &ldquo;For days he hasn&rsquo;t
eaten; of the six dishes that I set before him on the table he
doesn&rsquo;t touch even two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he sleeps badly,&rdquo;
replied the other servant. &ldquo;He has nightmares since he changed
his bedroom. His eyes are becoming more sunken all the time and
he&rsquo;s getting thinner and yellower day by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Truly, Padre Salvi was a pitiable sight. He did not care
to touch the second cup of chocolate nor to taste the sweet cakes of
Cebu; instead, he paced thoughtfully about the spacious sala, crumpling
in his bony hands the letters, which he read from time to time.
Finally, he called for his carriage, got ready, and directed that he be
taken to the wood where stood the fateful tree near which the picnic
was being held.</p>
<p class="par">Arriving at the edge of the wood, the padre dismissed
his carriage and made his way alone into its depths. A gloomy pathway
opened a difficult passage through the thickets and led to the brook
formed by certain warm springs, like many that flow from the slopes of
Mr. Makiling. Adorning its banks grow wild flowers, many of which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4539" href="#xd24e4539" name=
"xd24e4539">176</a>]</span>have as yet no Latin names, but which are
doubtless well-known to the gilded insects and butterflies of all
shapes and colors, blue and gold, white and black, many-hued,
glittering with iridescent spots, with rubies and emeralds on their
wings, and to the countless beetles with their metallic lusters of
powdered gold. The hum of the insects, the cries of the cicada, which
cease not night or day, the songs of the birds, and the dry crashing of
the rotten branch that falls and strikes all around against the trees,
are the only sounds to break the stillness of that mysterious
place.</p>
<p class="par">For some time the padre wandered aimlessly among the
thick underbrush, avoiding the thorns that caught at his
<i>guing&oacute;n</i> habit as though to detain him, and the roots of
the trees that protruded from the soil to form stumbling-blocks at
every step for this wanderer unaccustomed to such places. But suddenly
his feet were arrested by the sound of clear voices raised in merry
laughter, seeming to come from the brook and apparently drawing
nearer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see if I can find one of those
nests,&rdquo; said a beautiful, sweet voice, which the curate
recognized. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see <i>him</i> without having him
see me, so I could follow him everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi hid behind the trunk of a large tree and set
himself to eavesdrop.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does that mean that you want to do with him what
the curate does with you?&rdquo; asked a laughing voice. &ldquo;He
watches you everywhere. Be careful, for jealousy makes people thin and
puts rings around their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no, not jealousy, it&rsquo;s pure
curiosity,&rdquo; replied the silvery voice, while the laughing one
repeated, &ldquo;Yes, jealousy, jealousy!&rdquo; and she burst out into
merry laughter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I were jealous, instead of making myself
invisible, I&rsquo;d make him so, in order that no one might see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But neither would you see <i>him</i> and that
wouldn&rsquo;t be nice. The best thing for us to do if we find the nest
would be to present it to the curate so that he could watch
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4565" href="#xd24e4565" name=
"xd24e4565">177</a>]</span>over us without the necessity of our seeing
him, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in those herons&rsquo;
nests,&rdquo; interrupted another voice, &ldquo;but if at any time I
should be jealous, I&rsquo;d know how to watch and still keep myself
hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How, how? Perhaps like a <i>Sor
Escucha?</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4574src" href=
"#xd24e4574" name="xd24e4574src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">This reminiscence of school-days provoked another merry
burst of laughter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you know how she&rsquo;s fooled, the <i>Sor
Escucha!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">From his hiding-place Padre Salvi saw Maria Clara,
Victoria, and Sinang wading along the border of the brook. They were
moving forward with their eyes fixed on the crystal waters, seeking the
enchanted nest of the heron, wet to their knees so that the wide folds
of their bathing skirts revealed the graceful curves of their bodies.
Their hair was flung loose, their arms bare, and they wore camisas with
wide stripes of bright hues. While looking for something that they
could not find they were picking flowers and plants which grew along
the bank.</p>
<p class="par">The religious Acteon stood pale and motionless gazing at
that chaste Diana, but his eyes glittered in their dark circles,
untired of staring at those white and shapely arms and at that elegant
neck and bust, while the small rosy feet that played in the water awoke
in his starved being strange sensations and in his burning brain dreams
of new ideas.</p>
<p class="par">The three charming figures disappeared behind a bamboo
thicket around a bend in the brook, and their cruel allusions ceased to
be heard. Intoxicated, staggering, covered with perspiration, Padre
Salvi left his hiding-place and looked all about him with rolling eyes.
He stood still as if in doubt, then took a few steps as though he would
try to follow the girls, but turned again and made his way along the
banks of the stream to seek the rest of the party.</p>
<p class="par">At a little distance he saw in the middle of the brook a
kind of bathing-place, well enclosed, decorated with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4592" href="#xd24e4592" name=
"xd24e4592">178</a>]</span>palm leaves, flowers, and streamers, with a
leafy clump of bamboo for a covering, from within which came the sound
of happy feminine voices. Farther on he saw a bamboo bridge and beyond
it the men bathing. Near these a crowd of servants was busily engaged
around improvised <i>kalanes</i> in plucking chickens, washing rice,
and roasting a pig. On the opposite bank in a cleared space were
gathered men and women under a canvas covering which was fastened
partly to the hoary trees and partly to newly-driven stakes. There were
gathered the alferez, the coadjutor, the gobernadorcillo, the
teniente-mayor, the schoolmaster, and many other personages of the
town, even including Sinang&rsquo;s father, Capitan Basilio, who had
been the adversary of the deceased Don Rafael in an old lawsuit. Ibarra
had said to him, &ldquo;We are disputing over a point of law, but that
does not mean that we are enemies,&rdquo; so the celebrated orator of
the conservatives had enthusiastically accepted the invitation, sending
along three turkeys and putting his servants at the young man&rsquo;s
disposal.</p>
<p class="par">The curate was received with respect and deference by
all, even the alferez. &ldquo;Why, where has your Reverence
been?&rdquo; asked the latter, as he noticed the curate&rsquo;s
scratched face and his habit covered with leaves and dry twigs.
&ldquo;Has your Reverence had a fall?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, I lost my way,&rdquo; replied Padre Salvi,
lowering his gaze to examine his gown.</p>
<p class="par">Bottles of lemonade were brought out and green coconuts
were split open so that the bathers as they came from the water might
refresh themselves with the milk and the soft meat, whiter than the
milk itself. The girls all received in addition rosaries of
sampaguitas, intertwined with roses and ilang-ilang blossoms, to
perfume their flowing tresses. Some of the company sat on the ground or
reclined in hammocks swung from the branches of the trees, while others
amused themselves around a wide flat rock on which were to be seen
playing-cards, a chess-board, booklets, cowry shells, and pebbles.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4605" href=
"#xd24e4605" name="xd24e4605">179</a>]</span>They showed the cayman to
the curate, but he seemed inattentive until they told him that the
gaping wound had been inflicted by Ibarra. The celebrated and unknown
pilot was no longer to be seen, as he had disappeared before the
arrival of the alferez.</p>
<p class="par">At length Maria Clara came from the bath with her
companions, looking fresh as a rose on its first morning when the dew
sparkling on its fair petals glistens like diamonds. Her first smile
was for Crisostomo and the first cloud on her brow for Padre Salvi, who
noted it and sighed.</p>
<p class="par">The lunch hour was now come, and the curate, the
coadjutor, the gobernadorcillo, the teniente-mayor, and the other
dignitaries took their seats at the table over which Ibarra presided.
The mothers would not permit any of the men to eat at the table where
the young women sat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This time, Albino, you can&rsquo;t invent holes
as in the bankas,&rdquo; said Leon to the quondam student of theology.
&ldquo;What<i>!</i> What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the old women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The bankas, ladies, were as whole as this plate
is,&rdquo; explained Leon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> The rascal!&rdquo; exclaimed
the smiling Aunt Isabel.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you yet learned anything of the criminal who
assaulted Padre Damaso?&rdquo; inquired Fray Salvi of the alferez.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of what criminal, Padre?&rdquo; asked the
military man, staring at the friar over the glass of wine that he was
emptying,</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What criminal! Why, the one who struck Padre
Damaso in the road yesterday afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Struck Padre Damaso?&rdquo; asked several
voices.</p>
<p class="par">The coadjutor seemed to smile, while Padre Salvi went
on: &ldquo;Yes, and Padre Damaso is now confined to his bed. It&rsquo;s
thought that he may be the very same Elias who threw you into the
mudhole, se&ntilde;or alferez.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Either from shame or wine the alferez&rsquo;s face
became very red.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4637" href=
"#xd24e4637" name="xd24e4637">180</a>]</span>&ldquo;Of course, I
thought,&rdquo; continued Padre Salvi in a joking manner, &ldquo;that
you, the alferez of the Civil Guard, would be informed about the
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The soldier bit his lip and was murmuring some foolish
excuse, when the meal was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a
pale, thin, poorly-clad woman. No one had noticed her approach, for she
had come so noiselessly that at night she might have been taken for a
ghost.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Give this poor woman something to eat,&rdquo;
cried the old women. &ldquo;<i>Oy</i>, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Still the strange woman kept on her way to the table
where the curate was seated. As he turned his face and recognized her,
his knife dropped from his hand.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Give this woman something to eat,&rdquo; ordered
Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The night is dark and the boys disappear,&rdquo;
murmured the wandering woman, but at sight of the alferez, who spoke to
her, she became frightened and ran away among the trees.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An unfortunate woman who has become insane from
fear and sorrow,&rdquo; answered Don Filipo. &ldquo;For four days now
she has been so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is her name Sisa?&rdquo; asked Ibarra with
interest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your soldiers arrested her,&rdquo; continued the
teniente-mayor, rather bitterly, to the alferez. &ldquo;They marched
her through the town on account of something about her sons which
isn&rsquo;t very clearly known.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the alferez, turning to
the curate, &ldquo;she isn&rsquo;t the mother of your two
sacristans?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The curate nodded in affirmation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They disappeared and nobody made any inquiries
about them,&rdquo; added Don Filipo with a severe look at the
gobernadorcillo, who dropped his eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look for that woman,&rdquo; Crisostomo ordered
the servants. &ldquo;I promised to try to learn where her sons
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They disappeared, did you say?&rdquo; asked the
alferez. &ldquo;Your sacristans disappeared, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4672" href=
"#xd24e4672" name="xd24e4672">181</a>]</span>The friar emptied the
glass of wine before him and again nodded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, Padre!&rdquo; exclaimed the
alferez with a sarcastic laugh, pleased at the thought of a little
revenge. &ldquo;A few pesos of your Reverence&rsquo;s disappear and my
sergeant is routed out early to hunt for them&mdash;two sacristans
disappear and your Reverence says nothing&mdash;and you, se&ntilde;or
capitan&mdash;It&rsquo;s also true that you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here he broke off with another laugh as he buried his
spoon in the red meat of a wild papaya.</p>
<p class="par">The curate, confused, and not over-intent upon what he
was saying, replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I have to answer for
the money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A good answer, reverend shepherd of souls!&rdquo;
interrupted the alferez with his mouth full of food. &ldquo;A splendid
answer, holy man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra wished to intervene, but Padre Salvi controlled
himself by an effort and said with a forced smile, &ldquo;Then you
don&rsquo;t know, sir, what is said about the disappearance of those
boys? No? Then ask your soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the alferez, all his mirth
gone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that on the night they
disappeared several shots were heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Several shots?&rdquo; echoed the alferez, looking
around at the other guests, who nodded their heads in corroboration of
the padre&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi then replied slowly and with cutting
sarcasm: &ldquo;Come now, I see that you don&rsquo;t catch the
criminals nor do you know what is going on in your own house, yet you
try to set yourself up as a preacher to point out their duties to
others. You ought to keep in mind that proverb about the fool in his
own house&mdash;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e4696src" href=
"#xd24e4696" name="xd24e4696src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; interrupted Ibarra, seeing that
the alferez had grown pale. &ldquo;In this connection I should like to
have your opinion about a project of mine. I&rsquo;m thinking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4701" href="#xd24e4701" name=
"xd24e4701">182</a>]</span>of putting this crazy woman under the care
of a skilful physician and, in the meantime, with your aid and advice,
I&rsquo;ll search for her sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The return of the servants without the madwoman, whom
they had been unable to find, brought peace by turning the conversation
to other matters.</p>
<p class="par">The meal ended, and while the tea and coffee were being
served, both old and young scattered about in different groups. Some
took the chessmen, others the cards, while the girls, curious about the
future, chose to put questions to a <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo; called Capitan
Basilio in merry mood, &ldquo;we have a lawsuit fifteen years old, and
there isn&rsquo;t a judge in the Audiencia who can settle it.
Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t end it on the chess-board.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure,&rdquo; replied the
youth. &ldquo;Just wait a moment, the alferez is leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Upon hearing about this match all the old men who
understood chess gathered around the board, for it promised to be an
interesting one, and attracted even spectators who were not familiar
with the game. The old women, however, surrounded the curate in order
to converse with him about spiritual matters, but Fray Salvi apparently
did not consider the place and time appropriate, for he gave vague
answers and his sad, rather bored, looks wandered in all directions
except toward his questioners.</p>
<p class="par">The chess-match began with great solemnity. &ldquo;If
this game ends in a draw, it&rsquo;s understood that the lawsuit is to
be dropped,&rdquo; said Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">In the midst of the game Ibarra received a telegram
which caused his eyes to shine and his face to become pale. He put it
into his pocketbook, at the same time glancing toward the group of
young people, who were still with laughter and shouts putting questions
to Destiny.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Check to the king!&rdquo; called the youth.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Basilio had no other recourse than to hide the
piece behind the queen.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4726" href=
"#xd24e4726" name="xd24e4726">183</a>]</span>&ldquo;Check to the
queen!&rdquo; called the youth as he threatened that piece with a rook
which was defended by a pawn.</p>
<p class="par">Being unable to protect the queen or to withdraw the
piece on account of the king behind it, Capitan Basilio asked for time
to reflect.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; agreed Ibarra,
&ldquo;especially as I have something to say this very minute to those
young people in that group over there.&rdquo; He arose with the
agreement that his opponent should have a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p class="par">Iday had the round card on which were written the
forty-eight questions, while Albino held the book of answers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A lie! It&rsquo;s not so!&rdquo; cried Sinang,
half in tears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Maria
Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just imagine, I asked, &lsquo;When shall I have
some sense?&rsquo; I threw the dice and that worn-out priest read from
the book, &lsquo;When the frogs raise hair.&rsquo; What do you think of
that?&rdquo; As she said this, Sinang made a grimace at the laughing
ex-theological student.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who told you to ask that question?&rdquo; her
cousin Victoria asked her. &ldquo;To ask it is enough to deserve such
an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You ask a question,&rdquo; they said to Ibarra,
offering him the wheel. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re decided that whoever gets
the best answer shall receive a present from the rest. Each of us has
already had a question.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who got the best answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Maria Clara, Maria Clara!&rdquo; replied Sinang.
&ldquo;We made her ask, willy-nilly, &lsquo;Is your sweetheart faithful
and constant?&rsquo; And the book answered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But here the blushing Maria Clara put her hands over
Sinang&rsquo;s mouth so that she could not finish.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, give me the wheel,&rdquo; said Crisostomo,
smiling. &ldquo;My question is, &lsquo;Shall I succeed in my present
enterprise?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What an ugly question!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sinang.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra threw the dice and in accordance with the
resulting number the page and line were sought.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4758" href=
"#xd24e4758" name="xd24e4758">184</a>]</span>&ldquo;Dreams are
dreams,&rdquo; read Albino.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra drew out the telegram and opened it with
trembling hands. &ldquo;This time your book is wrong!&rdquo; he
exclaimed joyfully. &ldquo;Read this: &lsquo;School project approved.
Suit decided in your favor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; all asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that a present is to be
given to the one receiving the best answer?&rdquo; he asked in a voice
shaking with emotion as he tore the telegram carefully into two
pieces.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well then, this is my present,&rdquo; he said as
he gave one piece to Maria Clara. &ldquo;A school for boys and girls is
to be built in the town and this school is my present.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the other part, what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be given to the one who has
received the worst answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To me, then, to me!&rdquo; cried Sinang.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra gave her the other piece of the telegram and
hastily withdrew.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; she asked, but the
happy youth was already at a distance, returning to the game of
chess.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Salvi in abstracted mood approached the circle of
young people. Maria Clara wiped away her tears of joy, the laughter
ceased, and the talk died away. The curate stared at the young people
without offering to say anything, while they silently waited for him to
speak.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he at length asked,
picking up the book and turning its leaves.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>The Wheel of Fortune</i>, a book of
games,&rdquo; replied Leon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that it&rsquo;s a sin to
believe in these things?&rdquo; he scolded, tearing the leaves out
angrily.</p>
<p class="par">Cries of surprise and anger escaped from the lips of
all.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a greater sin to dispose of what
isn&rsquo;t yours, against the wish of the owner,&rdquo; contradicted
Albino, rising. &ldquo;Padre, that&rsquo;s what is called stealing and
it is forbidden by God and men!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4798" href=
"#xd24e4798" name="xd24e4798">185</a>]</span>Maria Clara clasped her
hands and gazed with tearful eyes at the remnants of the book which a
few moments before had been the source of so much happiness for
her.</p>
<p class="par">Contrary to the general expectation, Fray Salvi did not
reply to Albino, but stood staring at the torn leaves as they were
whirled about, some falling in the wood, some in the water, then he
staggered away with his hands over his head. He stopped for a few
moments to speak with Ibarra, who accompanied him to one of the
carriages, which were at the disposal of the guests.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing well to leave, that
kill-joy,&rdquo; murmured Sinang. &ldquo;He has a face that seems to
say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, for I know about your
sins!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After making the present to his fianc&eacute;e, Ibarra
was so happy that he began to play without reflection or a careful
examination of the positions of the pieces. The result was that
although Capitan Basilio was hard pressed the game became a stalemate,
owing to many careless moves on the young man&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled, we&rsquo;re at peace!&rdquo;
exclaimed Capitan Basilio heartily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re at peace,&rdquo; repeated the
youth, &ldquo;whatever the decision of the court may be.&rdquo; And the
two shook hands cordially.</p>
<p class="par">While all present were rejoicing over this happy
termination of a quarrel of which both parties were tired, the sudden
arrival of a sergeant and four soldiers of the Civil Guard, all armed
and with bayonets fixed, disturbed the mirth and caused fright among
the women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Keep still, everybody!&rdquo; shouted the
sergeant. &ldquo;Shoot any one who moves!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In spite of this blustering command, Ibarra arose and
approached the sergeant. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That you deliver to us at once a criminal named
Elias, who was your pilot this morning,&rdquo; was the threatening
reply.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4820" href=
"#xd24e4820" name="xd24e4820">186</a>]</span>&ldquo;A
criminal&mdash;the pilot? You must be mistaken,&rdquo; answered
Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir, this Elias has just been accused of
putting his hand on a priest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, was that the pilot?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The very same, according to reports. You admit
persons of bad character into your fiestas, Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra looked him over from head to foot and replied
with great disdain, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to give you an account of
my actions! At our fiestas all are welcome. Had you yourself come, you
would have found a place at our table, just as did your alferez, who
was with us a couple of hours ago.&rdquo; With this he turned his
back.</p>
<p class="par">The sergeant gnawed at the ends of his mustache but,
considering himself the weaker party, ordered the soldiers to institute
a search, especially among the trees, for the pilot, a description of
whom he carried on a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="par">Don Filipo said to him, &ldquo;Notice that this
description fits nine tenths of the natives. Don&rsquo;t make any false
move!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After a time the soldiers returned with the report that
they had been unable to see either banka or man that could be called
suspicious-looking, so the sergeant muttered a few words and went away
as he had come&mdash;in the manner of the Civil Guard!</p>
<p class="par">The merriment was little by little restored, amid
questions and comments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the Elias who threw the alferez
into the mudhole,&rdquo; said Leon thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How did that happen? How was it?&rdquo; asked
some of the more curious.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They say that on a very rainy day in September
the alferez met a man who was carrying a bundle of firewood. The road
was very muddy and there was only a narrow path at the side, wide
enough for but one person. They say that the alferez, instead of
reining in his pony, put spurs to it, at the same time calling to the
man to get out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4845" href=
"#xd24e4845" name="xd24e4845">187</a>]</span>of the way. It seemed that
this man, on account of the heavy load he was carrying on his shoulder,
had little relish for going back nor did he want to be swallowed up in
the mud, so he continued on his way forward. The alferez in irritation
tried to knock him down, but he snatched a piece of wood from his
bundle and struck the pony on the head with such great force that it
fell, throwing its rider into the mud. They also say that the man went
on his way tranquilly without taking any notice of the five bullets
that were fired after him by the alferez, who was blind with mud and
rage. As the man was entirely unknown to him it was supposed that he
might be the famous Elias who came to the province several months ago,
having come from no one knows where. He has given the Civil Guard cause
to know him in several towns for similar actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s a tulisan?&rdquo; asked Victoria
shuddering.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, for they say that he
fought against some tulisanes one day when they were robbing a
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t the look of a criminal,&rdquo;
commented Sinang.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, but he looks very sad. I didn&rsquo;t see him
smile the whole morning,&rdquo; added Maria Clara thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">So the afternoon passed away and the hour for returning
to the town came. Under the last rays of the setting sun they left the
woods, passing in silence by the mysterious tomb of Ibarra&rsquo;s
ancestors. Afterwards, the merry talk was resumed in a lively manner,
full of warmth, beneath those branches so little accustomed to hear so
many voices. The trees seemed sad, while the vines swung back and forth
as if to say, &ldquo;Farewell, youth! Farewell, dream of a
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Now in the light of the great red torches of bamboo and
with the sound of the guitars let us leave them on the road to the
town. The groups grow smaller, the lights are extinguished, the songs
die away, and the guitar becomes silent as they approach the abodes of
men. Put on the mask now that you are once more amongst your kind!

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXV</h2>
<h2 class="main">In the House of the Sage</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the morning of the following day, Ibarra, after
visiting his lands, made his way to the home of old Tasio. Complete
stillness reigned in the garden, for even the swallows circling about
the eaves scarcely made any noise. Moss grew on the old wall, over
which a kind of ivy clambered to form borders around the windows. The
little house seemed to be the abode of silence.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra hitched his horse carefully to a post and walking
almost on tiptoe crossed the clean and well-kept garden to the
stairway, which he ascended, and as the door was open, he entered. The
first sight that met his gaze was the old man bent over a book in which
he seemed to be writing. On the walls were collections of insects and
plants arranged among maps and stands filled with books and
manuscripts. The old man was so absorbed in his work that he did not
notice the presence of the youth until the latter, not wishing to
disturb him, tried to retire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, you here?&rdquo; he asked, gazing at Ibarra
with a strange expression. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; answered the youth,
&ldquo;I see that you&rsquo;re very busy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;True, I was writing a little, but it&rsquo;s not
urgent, and I want to rest. Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; answered Ibarra, drawing
nearer, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A glance at the book on the table caused him to exclaim
in surprise, &ldquo;What, are you given to deciphering
hieroglyphics?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the old man, as he offered his
visitor a chair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand Egyptian or Coptic
either, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4879" href="#xd24e4879"
name="xd24e4879">189</a>]</span>but I know something about the system
of writing, so I write in hieroglyphics.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You write in hieroglyphics! Why?&rdquo; exclaimed
the youth, doubting what he saw and heard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So that I cannot be read now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra gazed at him fixedly, wondering to himself if the
old man were not indeed crazy. He examined the book rapidly to learn if
he was telling the truth and saw neatly drawn figures of animals,
circles, semicircles, flowers, feet, hands, arms, and such things.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But why do you write if you don&rsquo;t want to
be read?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not writing for this
generation, but for other ages. If this generation could read, it would
burn my books, the labor of my whole life. But the generation that
deciphers these characters will be an intelligent generation, it will
understand and say, &lsquo;Not all were asleep in the night of our
ancestors!&rsquo; The mystery of these curious characters will save my
work from the ignorance of men, just as the mystery of strange rites
has saved many truths from the destructive priestly classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In what language do you write?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra after a pause.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In our own, Tagalog.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are the hieroglyphical signs suitable?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it were not for the difficulty of drawing
them, which takes time and patience, I would almost say that they are
more suitable than the Latin alphabet. The ancient Egyptian had our
vowels; our <i>o</i>, which is only final and is not like that of the
Spanish, which is a vowel between <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>. Like us, the
Egyptians lacked the true sound of <i>e</i>, and in their language are
found our <i>ha</i> and <i>kha</i>, which we do not have in the Latin
alphabet such as is used in Spanish. For example, in this word
<i>mukha</i>,&rdquo; he went on, pointing to the book, &ldquo;I
transcribe the syllable <i>ha</i> more correctly with the figure of a
fish than with the Latin <i>h</i>, which in Europe is pronounced in
different ways. For a weaker aspirate, as for example in this word
<i>ha&iacute;n</i>, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4931"
href="#xd24e4931" name="xd24e4931">190</a>]</span>the <i>h</i> has less
force, I avail myself of this lion&rsquo;s head or of these three lotus
flowers, according to the quantity of the vowel. Besides, I have the
nasal sound which does not exist in the Latin-Spanish alphabet. I
repeat that if it were not for the difficulty of drawing them exactly,
these hieroglyphics could almost be adopted, but this same difficulty
obliges me to be concise and not say more than what is exact and
necessary. Moreover, this work keeps me company when my guests from
China and Japan go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your guests from China and Japan?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear them? My guests are the
swallows. This year one of them is missing&mdash;some bad boy in China
or Japan must have caught it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How do you know that they come from those
countries?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Easily enough! Several years ago, before they
left I tied to the foot of each one a slip of paper with the name
&lsquo;Philippines&rsquo; in English on it, supposing that they must
not travel very far and because English is understood nearly
everywhere. For years my slips brought no reply, so that at last I had
it written in Chinese and here in the following November they have
returned with other notes which I have had deciphered. One is written
in Chinese and is a greeting from the banks of the Hoang-Ho and the
other, as the Chinaman whom I consulted supposes, must be in Japanese.
But I&rsquo;m taking your time with these things and haven&rsquo;t
asked you what I can do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to speak to you about a matter of
importance,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;Yesterday
afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have they caught that poor fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean Elias? How did you know about
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I saw the Muse of the Civil Guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Muse of the Civil Guard? Who is
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alferez&rsquo;s woman, whom you didn&rsquo;t
invite to your picnic. Yesterday morning the incident of the cayman
became known through the town. The Muse of the Civil <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4958" href="#xd24e4958" name=
"xd24e4958">191</a>]</span>Guard is as astute as she is malignant and
she guessed that the pilot must be the bold person who threw her
husband into the mudhole and who assaulted Padre Damaso. As she reads
all the reports that her husband is to receive, scarcely had he got
back home, drunk and not knowing what he was doing, when to revenge
herself on you she sent the sergeant with the soldiers to disturb the
merriment of your picnic. Be careful! Eve was a good woman, sprung from
the hands of God&mdash;they say that Do&ntilde;a Consolacion is evil
and it&rsquo;s not known whose hands she came from! In order to be
good, a woman needs to have been, at least sometime, either a maid or a
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra smiled slightly and replied by taking some
documents from his pocketbook. &ldquo;My dead father used to consult
you in some things and I recall that he had only to congratulate
himself on following your advice. I have on hand a little enterprise,
the success of which I must assure.&rdquo; Here he explained briefly
his plan for the school, which he had offered to his fianc&eacute;e,
spreading out in view of the astonished Sage some plans which had been
prepared in Manila.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I would like to have you advise me as to what
persons in the town I must first win over in order to assure the
success of the undertaking. You know the inhabitants well, while I have
just arrived and am almost a stranger in my own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Old Tasio examined the plans before him with tear-dimmed
eyes. &ldquo;What you are going to do has been my dream, the dream of a
poor lunatic!&rdquo; he exclaimed with emotion. &ldquo;And now the
first thing that I advise you to do is never to come to consult with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The youth gazed at him in surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because the sensible people,&rdquo; he continued
with bitter irony, &ldquo;would take you for a madman also. The people
consider madmen those who do not think as they do, so they hold me as
such, which I appreciate, because the day in which they think me
returned to sanity, they will deprive <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e4970" href="#xd24e4970" name="xd24e4970">192</a>]</span>me of the
little liberty that I&rsquo;ve purchased at the expense of the
reputation of being a sane individual. And who knows but they are
right? I do not live according to their rules, my principles and ideals
are different. The gobernadorcillo enjoys among them the reputation of
being a wise man because he learned nothing more than to serve
chocolate and to put up with Padre Damaso&rsquo;s bad humor, so now he
is wealthy, he disturbs the petty destinies of his fellow-townsmen, and
at times he even talks of justice. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a man of
talent,&rsquo; think the vulgar, &lsquo;look how from nothing he has
made himself great!&rsquo; But I, I inherited fortune and position, I
have studied, and now I am poor, I am not trusted with the most
ridiculous office, and all say, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a fool! He
doesn&rsquo;t know how to live!&rsquo; The curate calls me
&lsquo;philosopher&rsquo; as a nickname and gives to understand that I
am a charlatan who is making a show of what I learned in the higher
schools, when that is exactly what benefits me the least. Perhaps I
really am the fool and they the wise ones&mdash;who can say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man shook his head as if to drive away that
thought, and continued: &ldquo;The second thing I can advise is that
you consult the curate, the gobernadorcillo, and all persons in
authority. They will give you bad, stupid, or useless advice, but
consultation doesn&rsquo;t mean compliance, although you should make it
appear that you are taking their advice and acting according to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra reflected a moment before he replied: &ldquo;The
advice is good, but difficult to follow. Couldn&rsquo;t I go ahead with
my idea without a shadow being thrown upon it? Couldn&rsquo;t a worthy
enterprise make its way over everything, since truth doesn&rsquo;t need
to borrow garments from error?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nobody loves the naked truth!&rdquo; answered the
old man. &ldquo;That is good in theory and practicable in the world of
which youth dreams. Here is the schoolmaster, who has struggled in a
vacuum; with the enthusiasm of a child, he has sought the good, yet he
has won only jests and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4979" href=
"#xd24e4979" name="xd24e4979">193</a>]</span>laughter. You have said
that you are a stranger in your own country, and I believe it. The very
first day you arrived you began by wounding the vanity of a priest who
is regarded by the people as a saint, and as a sage among his fellows.
God grant that such a misstep may not have already determined your
future! Because the Dominicans and Augustinians look with disdain on
the <i>guing&oacute;n</i> habit, the rope girdle, and the immodest
foot-wear, because a learned doctor in Santo Tomas<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e4984src" href="#xd24e4984" name="xd24e4984src">1</a> may have
once recalled that Pope Innocent III described the statutes of that
order as more fit for hogs than men, don&rsquo;t believe but that all
of them work hand in hand to affirm what a preacher once said,
&lsquo;The most insignificant lay brother can do more than the
government with all its soldiers!&rsquo; <i>Cave ne cadas!</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e4989src" href="#xd24e4989" name="xd24e4989src">2</a>
Gold is powerful&mdash;the golden calf has thrown God down from His
altars many times, and that too since the days of Moses!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so pessimistic nor does life appear
to me so perilous in my country,&rdquo; said Ibarra with a smile.
&ldquo;I believe that those fears are somewhat exaggerated and I hope
to be able to carry out my plans without meeting any great opposition
in that quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, if they extend their hands to you; no, if
they withhold them. All your efforts will be shattered against the
walls of the rectory if the friar so much as waves his girdle or shakes
his habit; tomorrow the alcalde will on some pretext deny you what
today he has granted; no mother will allow her son to attend the
school, and then all your labors will produce a
counter-effect&mdash;they will dishearten those who afterwards may wish
to attempt altruistic undertakings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e4997" href=
"#xd24e4997" name="xd24e4997">194</a>]</span>&ldquo;But, after
all,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe in that
power of which you speak, and even supposing it to exist and making
allowance for it, I should still have on my side the sensible people
and the government, which is animated by the best intentions, which has
great hopes, and which frankly desires the welfare of the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The government! The government!&rdquo; muttered
the Sage, raising his eyes to stare at the ceiling. &ldquo;However
inspired it may be with the desire for fostering the greatness of the
country for the benefit of the country itself and of the mother
country, however some official or other may recall the generous spirit
of the Catholic Kings<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5001src" href=
"#xd24e5001" name="xd24e5001src">3</a> and may agree with it, too, the
government sees nothing, hears nothing, nor does it decide anything,
except what the curate or the Provincial causes it to see, hear, and
decide. The government is convinced that it depends for its salvation
wholly on them, that it is sustained because they uphold it, and that
the day on which they cease to support it, it will fall like a manikin
that has lost its prop. They intimidate the government with an uprising
of the people and the people with the forces of the government, whence
originates a simple game, very much like what happens to timid persons
when they visit gloomy places, taking for ghosts their own shadows and
for strange voices the echoes of their own. As long as the government
does not deal directly with the country it will not get away from this
tutelage, it will live like those imbecile youths who tremble at the
voice of their tutor, whose kindness they are begging for. The
government has no dream of a healthy future; it is the arm, while the
head is the convento. By this inertia with which it allows itself to be
dragged from depth to depth, it becomes changed into a shadow, its
integrity is impaired, and in a weak and incapable way it trusts
everything to mercenary hands. But compare our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5004" href="#xd24e5004" name=
"xd24e5004">195</a>]</span>system of government with those of the
countries you have visited&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted Ibarra,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s asking too much! Let us content ourselves with
observing that our people do not complain or suffer as do the people of
other countries, thanks to Religion and the benignity of the governing
powers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This people does not complain because it has no
voice, it does not move because it is lethargic, and you say that it
does not suffer because you haven&rsquo;t seen how its heart bleeds.
But some day you will see this, you will hear its complaints, and then
woe unto those who found their strength on ignorance and fanaticism!
Woe unto those who rejoice in deceit and labor during the night,
believing that all are asleep! When the light of day shows up the
monsters of darkness, the frightful reaction will come. So many sighs
suppressed, so much poison distilled drop by drop, so much force
repressed for centuries, will come to light and burst! Who then will
pay those accounts which oppressed peoples present from time to time
and which History preserves for us on her bloody pages?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God, the government, and Religion will not allow
that day to come!&rdquo; replied Ibarra, impressed in spite of himself.
&ldquo;The Philippines is religious and loves Spain, the Philippines
will realize how much the nation is doing for her. There are abuses,
yes, there are defects, that cannot be denied, but Spain is laboring to
introduce reforms that will correct these abuses and defects, she is
formulating plans, she is not selfish!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I know it, and that is the worst of it! The
reforms which emanate from the higher places are annulled in the lower
circles, thanks to the vices of all, thanks, for instance, to the eager
desire to get rich in a short time, and to the ignorance of the people,
who consent to everything. A royal decree does not correct abuses when
there is no zealous authority to watch over its execution, while
freedom of speech against the insolence of petty tyrants is not
conceded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5014" href="#xd24e5014"
name="xd24e5014">196</a>]</span>Plans will remain plans, abuses will
still be abuses, and the satisfied ministry will sleep in peace in
spite of everything. Moreover, if perchance there does come into a high
place a person with great and generous ideas, he will begin to hear,
while behind his back he is considered a fool, &lsquo;Your Excellency
does not know the country, your Excellency does not understand the
character of the Indians, your Excellency is going to ruin them, your
Excellency will do well to trust So-and-so,&rsquo; and his Excellency
in fact does not know the country, for he has been until now stationed
in America, and besides that, he has all the shortcomings and
weaknesses of other men, so he allows himself to be convinced. His
Excellency also remembers that to secure the appointment he has had to
sweat much and suffer more, that he holds it for only three years, that
he is getting old and that it is necessary to think, not of quixotisms,
but of the future: a modest mansion in Madrid, a cozy house in the
country, and a good income in order to live in luxury at the
capital&mdash;these are what he must look for in the Philippines. Let
us not ask for miracles, let us not ask that he who comes as an
outsider to make his fortune and go away afterwards should interest
himself in the welfare of the country. What matters to him the
gratitude or the curses of a people whom he does not know, in a country
where he has no associations, where he has no affections? Fame to be
sweet must resound in the ears of those we love, in the atmosphere of
our home or of the land that will guard our ashes; we wish that fame
should hover over our tomb to warm with its breath the chill of death,
so that we may not be completely reduced to nothingness, that something
of us may survive. Naught of this can we offer to those who come to
watch over our destinies. And the worst of all this is that they go
away just when they are beginning to get an understanding of their
duties. But we are getting away from our subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But before getting back to it I must make some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5019" href="#xd24e5019" name=
"xd24e5019">197</a>]</span>things plain,&rdquo; interrupted the youth
eagerly. &ldquo;I can admit that the government does not know the
people, but I believe that the people know the government even less.
There are useless officials, bad ones, if you wish, but there are also
good ones, and if these are unable to do anything it is because they
meet with an inert mass, the people, who take little part in the
affairs that concern them. But I didn&rsquo;t come to hold a discussion
with you on that point, I came to ask for advice and you tell me to
lower my head before grotesque idols!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, I repeat it, because here you must either
lower your head or lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Either lower my head or lose it!&rdquo; repeated
Ibarra thoughtfully. &ldquo;The dilemma is hard! But why? Is love for
my country incompatible with love for Spain? Is it necessary to debase
oneself to be a good Christian, to prostitute one&rsquo;s conscience in
order to carry out a good purpose? I love my native land, the
Philippines, because to it I owe my life and my happiness, because
every man should love his country. I love Spain, the fatherland of my
ancestors, because in spite of everything the Philippines owes to it,
and will continue to owe, her happiness and her future. I am a
Catholic, I preserve pure the faith of my fathers, and I do not see why
I have to lower my head when I can raise it, to give it over to my
enemies when I can humble them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because the field in which you wish to sow is in
possession of your enemies and against them you are powerless. It is
necessary that you first kiss the hand that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the youth let him go no farther, exclaiming
passionately, &ldquo;Kiss their hands! You forget that among them they
killed my father and threw his body from the tomb! I who am his son do
not forget it, and that I do not avenge it is because I have regard for
the good name of the Church!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old Sage bowed his head as he answered slowly:
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, if you preserve those memories, which I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5031" href="#xd24e5031" name=
"xd24e5031">198</a>]</span>cannot counsel you to forget, abandon the
enterprise you are undertaking and seek in some other way the welfare
of your countrymen. The enterprise needs another man, because to make
it a success zeal and money alone are not sufficient; in our country
are required also self-denial, tenacity of purpose, and faith, for the
soil is not ready, it is only sown with discord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra appreciated the value of these observations, but
still would not be discouraged. The thought of Maria Clara was in his
mind and his promise must be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t your experience suggest any other
than this hard means?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice.</p>
<p class="par">The old man took him by the arm and led him to the
window. A fresh breeze, the precursor of the north wind, was blowing,
and before their eyes spread out the garden bounded by the wide forest
that was a kind of park.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why can we not do as that weak stalk laden with
flowers and buds does?&rdquo; asked the Sage, pointing to a beautiful
jasmine plant. &ldquo;The wind blows and shakes it and it bows its head
as if to hide its precious load. If the stalk should hold itself erect
it would be broken, its flowers would be scattered by the wind, and its
buds would be blighted. The wind passes by and the stalk raises itself
erect, proud of its treasure, yet who will blame it for having bowed
before necessity? There you see that gigantic <i>kupang</i>, which
majestically waves its light foliage wherein the eagle builds his nest.
I brought it from the forest as a weak sapling and braced its stem for
months with slender pieces of bamboo. If I had transplanted it large
and full of life, it is certain that it would not have lived here, for
the wind would have thrown it down before its roots could have fixed
themselves in the soil, before it could have become accustomed to its
surroundings, and before it could have secured sufficient nourishment
for its size and height. So you, transplanted from Europe to this stony
soil, may end, if you do not seek support and do not humble yourself.
You are among evil conditions, alone, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5044" href="#xd24e5044" name="xd24e5044">199</a>]</span>elevated,
the ground shakes, the sky presages a storm, and the top of your family
tree has shown that it draws the thunderbolt. It is not courage, but
foolhardiness, to fight alone against all that exists. No one censures
the pilot who makes for a port at the first gust of the whirlwind. To
stoop as the bullet passes is not cowardly&mdash;it is worse to defy it
only to fall, never to rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But could this sacrifice produce the fruit that I
hope for?&rdquo; asked Ibarra. &ldquo;Would the priest believe in me
and forget the affront? Would they aid me frankly in behalf of the
education that contests with the conventos the wealth of the country?
Can they not pretend friendship, make a show of protection, and yet
underneath in the shadows fight it, undermine it, wound it in the heel,
in order to weaken it quicker than by attacking it in front? Granted
the previous actions which you surmise, anything may be
expected!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man remained silent from inability to answer
these questions. After meditating for some time, he said: &ldquo;If
such should happen, if the enterprise should fail, you would be
consoled by the thought that you had done what was expected of you and
thus something would be gained. You would have placed the first stone,
you would have sown the seed, and after the storm had spent itself
perhaps some grain would have survived the catastrophe to grow and save
the species from destruction and to serve afterwards as the seed for
the sons of the dead sower. The example may encourage others who are
only afraid to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Weighing these reasons, Ibarra realized the situation
and saw that with all the old man&rsquo;s pessimism there was a great
deal of truth in what he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pressing the
old man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Not in vain have I looked to you for
advice. This very day I&rsquo;ll go and reach an understanding with the
curate, who, after all is said, has done me no wrong and who must be
good, since all of them are not like the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5055" href="#xd24e5055" name=
"xd24e5055">200</a>]</span>persecutor of my father. I have, besides, to
interest him in behalf of that unfortunate madwoman and her sons. I put
my trust in God and men!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After taking leave of the old man he mounted his horse
and rode away. As the pessimistic Sage followed him with his gaze, he
muttered: &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s watch how Destiny will unfold the
drama that began in the cemetery.&rdquo; But for once he was greatly
mistaken&mdash;the drama had begun long before! <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Eve of the Fiesta</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is now the tenth of November, the eve of the
fiesta. Emerging from its habitual monotony, the town has given itself
over to unwonted activity in house, church, cockpit, and field. Windows
are covered with banners and many-hued draperies. All space is filled
with noise and music, and the air is saturated with rejoicings.</p>
<p class="par">On little tables with embroidered covers the
<i>dalagas</i> arrange in bright-hued glass dishes different kinds of
sweetmeats made from native fruits. In the yard the hens cackle, the
cocks crow, and the hogs grunt, all terrified by this merriment of man.
Servants move in and out carrying fancy dishes and silver cutlery. Here
there is a quarrel over a broken plate, there they laugh at the simple
country girl. Everywhere there is ordering, whispering, shouting.
Comments and conjectures are made, one hurries the other,&mdash;all is
commotion, noise, and confusion. All this effort and all this toil are
for the stranger as well as the acquaintance, to entertain every one,
whether he has been seen before or not, or whether he is expected to be
seen again, in order that the casual visitor, the foreigner, friend,
enemy, Filipino, Spaniard, the poor and the rich, may go away happy and
contented. No gratitude is even asked of them nor is it expected that
they do no damage to the hospitable family either during or after
digestion! The rich, those who have ever been to Manila and have seen a
little more than their neighbors, have bought beer, champagne,
liqueurs, wines, and food-stuffs from Europe, of which they will hardly
taste a bite or drink a drop.</p>
<p class="par">Their tables are luxuriously furnished. In the center
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5074" href="#xd24e5074" name=
"xd24e5074">202</a>]</span>is a well-modeled artificial pineapple in
which are arranged toothpicks elaborately carved by convicts in their
rest-hours. Here they have designed a fan, there a bouquet of flowers,
a bird, a rose, a palm leaf, or a chain, all wrought from a single
piece of wood, the artisan being a forced laborer, the tool a dull
knife, and the taskmaster&rsquo;s voice the inspiration. Around this
toothpick-holder are placed glass fruit-trays from which rise pyramids
of oranges, lansons, ates, chicos, and even mangos in spite of the fact
that it is November. On wide platters upon bright-hued sheets of
perforated paper are to be seen hams from Europe and China, stuffed
turkeys, and a big pastry in the shape of an Agnus Dei or a dove, the
Holy Ghost perhaps. Among all these are jars of appetizing
<i>acharas</i> with fanciful decorations made from the flowers of the
areca palm and other fruits and vegetables, all tastefully cut and
fastened with sirup to the sides of the flasks.</p>
<p class="par">Glass lamp globes that have been handed down from father
to son are cleaned, the copper ornaments polished, the kerosene lamps
taken out of the red wrappings which have protected them from the flies
and mosquitoes during the year and which have made them unserviceable;
the prismatic glass pendants shake to and fro, they clink together
harmoniously in song, and even seem to take part in the fiesta as they
flash back and break up the rays of light, reflecting them on the white
walls in all the colors of the rainbow. The children play about amusing
themselves by chasing the colors, they stumble and break the globes,
but this does not interfere with the general merriment, although at
other times in the year the tears in their round eyes would be taken
account of in a different way.</p>
<p class="par">Along with these venerated lamps there also come forth
from their hiding-places the work of the girls: crocheted scarfs, rugs,
artificial flowers. There appear old glass trays, on the bottoms of
which are sketched miniature lakes with little fishes, caymans,
shell-fish, seaweeds, coral, and glassy stones of brilliant hues. These
are heaped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5083" href="#xd24e5083"
name="xd24e5083">203</a>]</span>with cigars, cigarettes, and diminutive
buyos prepared by the delicate fingers of the maidens. The floor of the
house shines like a mirror, curtains of pi&ntilde;a and husi festoon
the doorways, from the windows hang lanterns covered with glass or with
paper, pink, blue, green, or red. The house itself is filled with
plants and flower-pots on stands of Chinese porcelain. Even the saints
bedeck themselves, the images and relics put on a festive air, the dust
is brushed from them and on the freshly-washed glass of their cases are
hung flowery garlands.</p>
<p class="par">In the streets are raised at intervals fanciful bamboo
arches, known as <i>sink&aacute;ban</i>, constructed in various ways
and adorned with <i>kalusk&uacute;s</i>, the curling bunches of
shavings scraped on their sides, at the sight of which alone the hearts
of the children rejoice. About the front of the church, where the
procession is to pass, is a large and costly canopy upheld on bamboo
posts. Beneath this the children run and play, climbing, jumping, and
tearing the new camisas in which they should shine on the principal day
of the fiesta.</p>
<p class="par">There on the plaza a platform has been erected, the
scenery being of bamboo, nipa, and wood; there the Tondo comedians will
perform wonders and compete with the gods in improbable miracles, there
will sing and dance Marianito, Chananay, Balbino, Ratia, Carvajal,
Yeyeng, Liceria, etc. The Filipino enjoys the theater and is a deeply
interested spectator of dramatic representations, but he listens in
silence to the song, he gazes delighted at the dancing and mimicry, he
never hisses or applauds.</p>
<p class="par">If the show is not to his liking, he chews his buyo or
withdraws without disturbing the others who perhaps find pleasure in
it. Only at times the commoner sort will howl when the actors embrace
or kiss the actresses, but they never go beyond that. Formerly, dramas
only were played; the local poet composed a piece in which there must
necessarily be a fight every second minute, a clown, and terrifying
transformations. But since the Tondo artist <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5097" href="#xd24e5097" name=
"xd24e5097">204</a>]</span>have begun to fight every fifteen seconds,
with two clowns, and even greater marvels than before, they have put to
rout their provincial compeers. The gobernadorcillo was very fond of
this sort of thing, so, with the approval of the curate, he chose a
spectacle with magic and fireworks, entitled, &ldquo;The Prince
Villardo or the Captives Rescued from the Infamous
Cave.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5099src" href="#xd24e5099"
name="xd24e5099src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">From time to time the bells chime out merrily, those
same bells that ten days ago were tolling so mournfully. Pin-wheels and
mortars rend the air, for the Filipino pyrotechnist, who learned the
art from no known instructor, displays his ability by preparing fire
bulls, castles of Bengal lights, paper balloons inflated with hot air,
bombs, rockets, and the like.</p>
<p class="par">Now distant strains of music are heard and the small
boys rush headlong toward the outskirts of the town to meet the bands
of music, five of which have been engaged, as well as three orchestras.
The band of Pagsanhan belonging to the escribano must not be lacking
nor that of San Pedro de Tunasan, at that time famous because it was
directed by the maestro Austria, the vagabond &ldquo;Corporal
Mariano&rdquo; who, according to report, carried fame and harmony in
the tip of his baton. Musicians praise his funeral march, &ldquo;El
Sauce,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5113src" href="#xd24e5113"
name="xd24e5113src">2</a> and deplore his lack of musical education,
since with his genius he might have brought glory to his country. The
bands enter the town playing lively airs, followed by ragged or
half-naked urchins, one in the camisa of his brother, another in his
father&rsquo;s pantaloons. As soon as the band ceases, the boys know
the piece by heart, they hum and whistle it with rare skill, they

arriving in conveyances of all kinds relatives, friends, strangers, the
gamblers with their best game-cocks and their bags of gold, ready to
risk their fortune on the green cloth or within the arena of the
cockpit.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alferez has fifty pesos for each

latest arrivals. &ldquo;Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s coming and will set up a
bank; Capitan Joaquin&rsquo;s bringing eighteen thousand.

going to be on a big scale, yes, sir, on a grand scale! But have some
chocolate! This year Capitan Tiago won&rsquo;t break us as he did last,
since he&rsquo;s paid for only three thanksgiving masses and I&rsquo;ve
got a cacao <i>muty&acirc;</i>. And how&rsquo;s your family?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, thank you,&rdquo; the visitors respond,
&ldquo;and Padre Damaso?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre Damaso will preach in the morning and sit
in with us at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good enough! Then there&rsquo;s no
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;re sure! Carlos the Chinaman will
loosen up also.&rdquo; Here the chubby individual works his fingers as
though counting out pieces of money.</p>
<p class="par">Outside the town the hill-folk, the
<i>kasam&aacute;</i>, are putting on their best clothes to carry to the
houses of their landlords well-fattened chickens, wild pigs, deer, and
birds. Some load firewood on the heavy carts, others fruits, ferns, and
orchids, the rarest that grow in the forests, others bring broad-leafed
caladiums and flame-colored <i>tikas-tikas</i> blossoms to decorate the
doors of the houses.</p>
<p class="par">But the place where the greatest activity reigns, where
it is converted into a tumult, is there on a little plot of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5148" href="#xd24e5148" name=
"xd24e5148">206</a>]</span>raised ground, a few steps from
Ibarra&rsquo;s house. Pulleys screech and yells are heard amid the
metallic sound of iron striking upon stone, hammers upon nails, of axes
chopping out posts. A crowd of laborers is digging in the earth to open
a wide, deep trench, while others place in line the stones taken from
the town quarries. Carts are unloaded, piles of sand are heaped up,
windlasses and derricks are set in place.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hey, you there! Hurry up!&rdquo; cries a little
old man with lively and intelligent features, who has for a cane a
copper-bound rule around which is wound the cord of a plumb-bob. This
is the foreman of the work, &Ntilde;or Juan, architect, mason,
carpenter, painter, locksmith, stonecutter, and, on occasions,
sculptor. &ldquo;It must be finished right now! Tomorrow there&rsquo;ll
be no work and the day after tomorrow is the ceremony.
Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cut that hole so that this cylinder will fit it
exactly,&rdquo; he says to some masons who are shaping a large square
block of stone. &ldquo;Within that our names will be
preserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He repeats to every newcomer who approaches the place
what he has already said a thousand times: &ldquo;You know what
we&rsquo;re going to build? Well, it&rsquo;s a schoolhouse, a model of
its kind, like those in Germany, and even better. A great architect has
drawn the plans, and I&mdash;I am bossing the job! Yes, sir, look at
it, it&rsquo;s going to be a palace with two wings, one for the boys
and the other for the girls. Here in the middle a big garden with three
fountains, there on the sides shaded walks with little plots for the
children to sow and cultivate plants in during their recess-time, that
they may improve the hours and not waste them. Look how deep the
foundations are, three meters and seventy-five centimeters! This
building is going to have storerooms, cellars, and for those who are
not diligent students dungeons near the playgrounds so that the
culprits may hear how the studious children are enjoying themselves. Do
you see that big space? That will be a lawn for running and exercising
in the open air. The little girls <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5157" href="#xd24e5157" name="xd24e5157">207</a>]</span>will have
a garden with benches, swings, walks where they can jump the rope,
fountains, bird-cages, and so on. It&rsquo;s going to be
magnificent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then &Ntilde;or Juan would rub his hands together as he
thought of the fame that he was going to acquire. Strangers would come
to see it and would ask, &ldquo;Who was the great artisan that built
this?&rdquo; and all would answer, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? Can it
be that you&rsquo;ve never heard of &Ntilde;or Juan? Undoubtedly
you&rsquo;ve come from a great distance!&rdquo; With these thoughts he
moved from one part to the other, examining and reexamining
everything.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me that there&rsquo;s too much timber
for one derrick,&rdquo; he remarked to a yellowish man who was
overseeing some laborers. &ldquo;I should have enough with three large
beams for the tripod and three more for the braces.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; answered the yellowish man,
smiling in a peculiar way. &ldquo;The more apparatus we use in the
work, so much the greater effect we&rsquo;ll get. The whole thing will
look better and of more importance, so they&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;How
hard they&rsquo;ve worked!&rsquo; You&rsquo;ll see, you&rsquo;ll see
what a derrick I&rsquo;ll put up! Then I&rsquo;ll decorate it with
banners, and garlands of leaves and flowers. You&rsquo;ll say
afterwards that you were right in hiring me as one of your laborers,
and Se&ntilde;or Ibarra couldn&rsquo;t ask for more!&rdquo; As he said
this the man laughed and smiled. &Ntilde;or Juan also smiled, but shook
his head.</p>
<p class="par">Some distance away were seen two kiosks united by a kind
of arbor covered with banana leaves. The schoolmaster and some thirty
boys were weaving crowns and fastening banners upon the frail bamboo
posts, which were wrapped in white cloth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take care that the letters are well
written,&rdquo; he admonished the boys who were preparing inscriptions.
&ldquo;The alcalde is coming, many curates will be present, perhaps
even the Captain-General, who is now in the province. If they see that
you draw well, maybe they&rsquo;ll praise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5170" href=
"#xd24e5170" name="xd24e5170">208</a>]</span>&ldquo;And give us a
blackboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps, but Se&ntilde;or Ibarra has already
ordered one from Manila. Tomorrow some things will come to be
distributed among you as prizes. Leave those flowers in the water and
tomorrow we&rsquo;ll make the bouquets. Bring more flowers, for
it&rsquo;s necessary that the table be covered with them&mdash;flowers
please the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My father will bring some water-lilies and a
basket of sampaguitas tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mine has brought three cartloads of sand without
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My uncle has promised to pay a teacher,&rdquo;
added a nephew of Capitan Basilio.</p>
<p class="par">Truly, the project was receiving help from all. The
curate had asked to stand sponsor for it and himself bless the laying
of the corner-stone, a ceremony to take place on the last day of the
fiesta as one of its greatest solemnities. The very coadjutor had
timidly approached Ibarra with an offer of all the fees for masses that
the devout would pay until the building was finished. Even more, the
rich and economical Sister Rufa had declared that if money should be
lacking she would canvass other towns and beg for alms, with the mere
condition that she be paid her expenses for travel and subsistence.
Ibarra thanked them all, as he answered, &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t going
to have anything very great, since I am not rich and this building is
not a church. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t undertake to erect it at the
expense of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The younger men, students from Manila, who had come to
take part in the fiesta, gazed at him in admiration and took him for a
model; but, as it nearly always happens, when we wish to imitate great
men, that we copy only their foibles and even their defects, since we
are capable of nothing else, so many of these admirers took note of the
way in which he tied his cravat, others of the style of his collar, and
not a few of the number of buttons on his coat and vest.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5186" href=

of old Tasio seemed to have been dissipated forever. So Ibarra observed
to him one day, but the old pessimist answered: &ldquo;Remember what

<p class="par footnote cont">Francisco Baltazar was a Tagalog poet,
native of the province of Bulacan, born about 1788, and died in 1862.
The greater part of his life was spent in Manila,&mdash;in Tondo and in
Pandakan, a quaint little village on the south bank of the Pasig, now
included in the city, where he appears to have shared the fate largely
of poets of other lands, from suffering &ldquo;the pangs of disprized
love&rdquo; and persecution by the religious authorities, to seeing
himself considered by the people about him as a crack-brained dreamer.
He was educated in the Dominican school of San Juan de Letran, one of
his teachers being Fray Mariano Pilapil, about whose services to
humanity there may be some difference of opinion on the part of those
who have ever resided in Philippine towns, since he was the author of
the &ldquo;Passion Song&rdquo; which enlivens the Lenten evenings. This
&ldquo;Passion Song,&rdquo; however, seems to have furnished the model
for Baltazar&rsquo;s <i>Florante</i>, with the pupil surpassing the
master, for while it has the subject and characters of a medieval
European romance, the spirit and settings are entirely Malay. It is
written in the peculiar Tagalog verse, in the form of a <i>corrido</i>
or metrical romance, and has been declared by Fray Toribio Menguella,
Rizal himself, and others familiar with Tagalog, to be a work of no
mean order, by far the finest and most characteristic composition in
that, the richest of the Malay dialects.&mdash;TR.&nbsp;<a class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">In the Twilight</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house also great
preparations had been made. We know its owner, whose love of
ostentation and whose pride as a Manilan imposed the necessity of
humiliating the provincials with his splendor. Another reason, too,
made it his duty to eclipse all others: he had his daughter Maria Clara
with him, and there was present his future son-in-law, who was
attracting universal attention.</p>
<p class="par">In fact one of the most serious newspapers in Manila had
devoted to Ibarra an article on its front page, entitled,
&ldquo;Imitate him!&rdquo; heaping him with praise and giving him some
advice. It had called him, &ldquo;The cultivated young gentleman and
rich capitalist;&rdquo; two lines further on, &ldquo;The distinguished
philanthropist;&rdquo; in the following paragraph, &ldquo;The disciple
of Minerva who had gone to the mother country to pay his respects to
the true home of the arts and sciences;&rdquo; and a little further on,
&ldquo;The Filipino Spaniard.&rdquo; Capitan Tiago burned with generous
zeal to imitate him and wondered whether he ought not to erect a
convento at his own expense.</p>
<p class="par">Some days before there had arrived at the house where
Maria Clara and Aunt Isabel were staying a profusion of eases of
European wines and food-stuffs, colossal mirrors, paintings, and Maria
Clara&rsquo;s piano. Capitan Tiago had arrived on the day before the
fiesta and as his daughter kissed his hand, had presented her with a
beautiful locket set with diamonds and emeralds, containing a sliver
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Peter&rsquo;s boat, in which
Our Savior sat during the fishing. His first interview with his future
son-in-law could not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5229" href=
"#xd24e5229" name="xd24e5229">211</a>]</span>have been more cordial.
Naturally, they talked about the school, and Capitan Tiago wanted it
named &ldquo;School of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis.&rdquo; &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis is a good
patron. If you call it &lsquo;School of Primary Instruction,&rsquo; you
will gain nothing. Who is Primary Instruction, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Some friends of Maria Clara came and asked her to go for
a walk. &ldquo;But come back quickly,&rdquo; said Capitan Tiago to his
daughter, when she asked his permission, &ldquo;for you know that Padre
Damaso, who has just arrived, will dine with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then turning to Ibarra, who had become thoughtful, he
said, &ldquo;You dine with us also, you&rsquo;ll be all alone in your
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I would with the greatest pleasure, but I have to
be at home in case visitors come,&rdquo; stammered the youth, as he
avoided the gaze of Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bring your friends along,&rdquo; replied Capitan
Tiago heartily. &ldquo;In my house there&rsquo;s always plenty to eat.
Also, I want you and Padre Damaso to get on good terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be time enough for that,&rdquo;
answered Ibarra with a forced smile, as he prepared to accompany the
girls.</p>
<p class="par">They went downstairs, Maria Clara in the center between
Victoria and Iday, Aunt Isabel following. The people made way for them
respectfully. Maria Clara was startling in her beauty; her pallor was
all gone, and if her eyes were still pensive, her mouth on the contrary
seemed to know only smiles. With maiden friendliness the happy young
woman greeted the acquaintances of her childhood, now the admirers of
her promising youth. In less than a fortnight she had succeeded in
recovering that frank confidence, that childish prattle, which seemed
to have been benumbed between the narrow walls of the nunnery. It might
be said that on leaving the cocoon the butterfly recognized all the
flowers, for it seemed to be enough for her to spread her wings for a
moment and warm herself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5249" href=
"#xd24e5249" name="xd24e5249">212</a>]</span>in the sun&rsquo;s rays to
lose all the stiffness of the chrysalis. This new life manifested
itself in her whole nature. Everything she found good and beautiful,
and she showed her love with that maiden modesty which, having never
been conscious of any but pure thoughts, knows not the meaning of false
blushes. While she would cover her face when she was teased, still her
eyes smiled, and a light thrill would course through her whole
being.</p>
<p class="par">The houses were beginning to show lights, and in the
streets where the music was moving about there were lighted torches of
bamboo and wood made in imitation of those in the church. From the
streets the people in the houses might be seen through the windows in
an atmosphere of music and flowers, moving about to the sounds of
piano, harp, or orchestra. Swarming in the streets were Chinese,
Spaniards, Filipinos, some dressed in European style, some in the
costumes of the country. Crowding, elbowing, and pushing one another,
walked servants carrying meat and chickens, students in white, men and
women, all exposing themselves to be knocked down by the carriages
which, in spite of the drivers&rsquo; cries, made their way with
difficulty.</p>
<p class="par">In front of Capitan Basilio&rsquo;s house some young
women called to our acquaintances and invited them to enter. The merry
voice of Sinang as she ran down the stairs put an end to all excuses.
&ldquo;Come up a moment so that I may go with you,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored staying here among so many strangers who talk
only of game-cocks and cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They were ushered into a large room filled with people,
some of whom came forward to greet Ibarra, for his name was now well
known. All gazed in ecstasy at the beauty of Maria Clara and some old
women murmured, as they chewed their buyo, &ldquo;She looks like the
Virgin!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There they had to have chocolate, as Capitan Basilio had
become a warm friend and defender of Ibarra since the day of the
picnic. He had learned from the half of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5260" href="#xd24e5260" name=
"xd24e5260">213</a>]</span>telegram given to his daughter Sinang that
Ibarra had known beforehand about the court&rsquo;s decision in the
latter&rsquo;s favor, so, not wishing to be outdone in generosity, he
had tried to set aside the decision of the chess-match. But when Ibarra
would not consent to this, he had proposed that the money which would
have been spent in court fees should be used to pay a teacher in the
new school. In consequence, the orator employed all his eloquence to
the end that other litigants should give up their extravagant claims,
saying to them, &ldquo;Believe me, in a lawsuit the winner is left
without a camisa.&rdquo; But he had succeeded in convincing no one,
even though he cited the Romans.</p>
<p class="par">After drinking the chocolate our young people had to
listen to piano-playing by the town organist. &ldquo;When I listen to
him in the church,&rdquo; exclaimed Sinang, pointing to the organist,
&ldquo;I want to dance, and now that he&rsquo;s playing here I feel
like praying, so I&rsquo;m going out with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to join us tonight?&rdquo;
whispered Capitan Basilio into Ibarra&rsquo;s ear as they were leaving.
&ldquo;Padre Damaso is going to set up a little bank.&rdquo; Ibarra
smiled and answered with an equivocal shake of his head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Maria Clara of
Victoria, indicating with a rapid glance a youth who was following
them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s a cousin of
mine,&rdquo; she answered with some agitation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no cousin of mine,&rdquo; put in
Sinang merrily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my uncle&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They passed in front of the parish rectory, which was
not one of the least animated buildings. Sinang was unable to repress
an exclamation of surprise on seeing the lamps burning, those lamps of
antique pattern which Padre Salvi had never allowed to be lighted, in
order not to waste kerosene. Loud talk and resounding bursts of
laughter might be heard as the friars moved slowly about, nodding their
heads in unison with the big cigars that adorned their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5276" href="#xd24e5276" name=
"xd24e5276">214</a>]</span>lips. The laymen with them, who from their
European garments appeared to be officials and employees of the
province, were endeavoring to imitate whatever the good priests did.
Maria Clara made out the rotund figure of Padre Damaso at the side of
the trim silhouette of Padre Sibyla. Motionless in his place stood the
silent and mysterious Fray Salvi.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sad,&rdquo; observed Sinang,
&ldquo;for he&rsquo;s thinking about how much so many visitors are
going to cost. But you&rsquo;ll see how he&rsquo;ll not pay it himself,
but the sacristans will. His visitors always eat at other
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sinang!&rdquo; scolded Victoria.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to endure him since he
tore up the <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>. I don&rsquo;t go to confession to
him any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Of all the houses one only was to be noticed without
lights and with all the windows closed&mdash;that of the alferez. Maria
Clara expressed surprise at this.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The witch! The Muse of the Civil Guard, as the
old man says,&rdquo; exclaimed the irrepressible Sinang. &ldquo;What
has she to do with our merrymakings? I imagine she&rsquo;s raging! But
just let the cholera come and you&rsquo;d see her give a
banquet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Sinang!&rdquo; again her cousin scolded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I never was able to endure her and especially
since she disturbed our picnic with her civil-guards. If I were the
Archbishop I&rsquo;d marry Her to Padre Salvi&mdash;then think what
children! Look how she tried to arrest the poor pilot, who threw
himself into the water simply to please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She was not allowed to finish, for in the corner of the
plaza where a blind man was singing to the accompaniment of a guitar, a
curious spectacle was presented. It was a man miserably dressed,
wearing a broad salakot of palm leaves. His clothing consisted of a
ragged coat and wide pantaloons, like those worn by the Chinese, torn
in many places. Wretched sandals covered his feet. His countenance
remained hidden in the shadow of his wide <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5298" href="#xd24e5298" name="xd24e5298">215</a>]</span>hat, but
from this shadow there flashed intermittently two burning rays. Placing
a flat basket on the ground, he would withdraw a few paces and utter
strange, incomprehensible sounds, remaining the while standing entirely
alone as if he and the crowd were mutually avoiding each other. Then
some women would approach the basket and put into it fruit, fish, or
rice. When no one any longer approached, from the shadows would issue
sadder but less pitiful sounds, cries of gratitude perhaps. Then he
would take up the basket and make his way to another place to repeat
the same performance.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara divined that there must be some misfortune
there, and full of interest she asked concerning the strange
creature.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a leper,&rdquo; Iday told her.
&ldquo;Four years ago he contracted the disease, some say from taking
care of his mother, others from lying in a damp prison. He lives in the
fields near the Chinese cemetery, having intercourse with no one,
because all flee from him for fear of contagion. If you might only see
his home! It&rsquo;s a tumbledown shack, through which the wind and
rain pass like a needle through cloth. He has been forbidden to touch
anything belonging to the people. One day when a little child fell into
a shallow ditch as he was passing, he helped to get it out. The
child&rsquo;s father complained to the gobernadorcillo, who ordered
that the leper be flogged through the streets and that the rattan be
burned afterwards. It was horrible! The leper fled with his flogger in
pursuit, while the gobernadorcillo cried, &lsquo;Catch him! Better be
drowned than get the disease you have!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can it be true!&rdquo; murmured Maria Clara,
then, without saying what she was about to do, went up to the
wretch&rsquo;s basket and dropped into it the locket her father had
given her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; her friends asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t anything else,&rdquo; she
answered, trying to conceal her tears with a smile.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5312" href=
"#xd24e5312" name="xd24e5312">216</a>]</span>&ldquo;What is he going to
do with your locket?&rdquo; Victoria asked her. &ldquo;One day they
gave him some money, but he pushed it away with a stick; why should he
want it when no one accepts anything that comes from him? As if the
locket could be eaten!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara gazed enviously at the women who were
selling food-stuffs and shrugged her shoulders. The leper approached
the basket, picked up the jeweled locket, which glittered in his hands,
then fell upon his knees, kissed it, and taking off his salakot buried
his forehead in the dust where the maiden had stepped. Maria Clara hid
her face behind her fan and raised her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, a poor woman had approached the leper, who
seemed to be praying. Her long hair was loose and unkempt, and in the
light of the torches could be recognized the extremely emaciated
features of the crazy Sisa. Feeling the touch of her hand, the leper
jumped up with a cry, but to the horror of the onlooker&rsquo;s Sisa
caught him by the arm and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let us pray, let us pray! Today is All
Souls&rsquo; day! Those lights are the souls of men! Let us pray for my
sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Separate them! Separate them! The madwoman will
get the disease!&rdquo; cried the crowd, but no one dared to go near
them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you see that light in the tower? That is my
son Basilio sliding down a rope! Do you see that light in the convento?
That is my son Crispin! But I&rsquo;m not going to see them because the
curate is sick and had many gold pieces and the gold pieces are lost!
Pray, let us pray for the soul of the curate! I took him the finest
fruits, for my garden was full of flowers and I had two sons! I had a
garden, I used to take care of my flowers, and I had two
sons!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then releasing her hold of the leper, she ran away
singing, &ldquo;I had a garden and flowers, I had two sons, a garden,
and flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5327" href=
"#xd24e5327" name="xd24e5327">217</a>]</span>&ldquo;What have you been
able to do for that poor woman?&rdquo; Maria Clara asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing! Lately she has been missing from the
totem and wasn&rsquo;t to be found,&rdquo; answered the youth, rather
confusedly. &ldquo;Besides, I have been very busy. But don&rsquo;t let
it trouble you. The curate has promised to help me, but advised that I
proceed with great tact and caution, for the Civil Guard seems to be
mixed up in it. The curate is greatly interested in her
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the alferez say that he would have
search made for her sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, but at the time he was
somewhat&mdash;drunk.&rdquo; Scarcely had he said this when they saw
the crazy woman being led, or rather dragged along, by a soldier. Sisa
was offering resistance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why are you arresting her? What has she
done?&rdquo; asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, haven&rsquo;t you seen how she&rsquo;s been
raising a disturbance?&rdquo; was the reply of the guardian of the
public peace.</p>
<p class="par">The leper caught up his basket hurriedly and ran
away.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara wanted to go home, as she had lost all her
mirth and good humor. &ldquo;So there are people who are not
happy,&rdquo; she murmured. Arriving at her door, she felt her sadness
increase when her fianc&eacute; declined to go in, excusing himself on
the plea of necessity. Maria Clara went upstairs thinking what a bore
are the fiesta days, when strangers make their visits. <span class=

<p class="par first">As nothing of importance to our characters
happened during the first two days, we should gladly pass on to the
third and last, were it not that perhaps some foreign reader may wish
to know how the Filipinos celebrate their fiestas. For this reason we
shall faithfully reproduce in this chapter several letters, one of them
being that of the correspondent of a noted Manila newspaper, respected
for its grave tone and deep seriousness. Our readers will correct some
natural and trifling slips of the pen. Thus the worthy correspondent of
the respectable newspaper wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;TO THE EDITOR, MY DISTINGUISHED
FRIEND,&mdash;Never did I witness, nor had I ever expected to see in
the provinces, a religious fiesta so solemn, so splendid, and so
impressive as that now being celebrated in this town by the Most
Reverend and virtuous Franciscan Fathers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Great crowds are in attendance. I have here had
the pleasure of greeting nearly all the Spaniards who reside in this
province, three Reverend Augustinian Fathers from the province of
Batangas, and two Reverend Dominican Fathers. One of the latter is the
Very Reverend Fray Hernando Sibyla, who has come to honor this town
with his presence, a distinction which its worthy inhabitants should
never forget. I have also seen a great number of the best people of
Cavite and Pampanga, many wealthy persons from Manila, and many bands
of music,&mdash;among these the very artistic one of Pagsanhan
belonging to the escribano, Don Miguel Guevara,&mdash;swarms of
Chinamen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5362" href="#xd24e5362"
name="xd24e5362">219</a>]</span>and Indians, who, with the curiosity of
the former and the piety of the latter, awaited anxiously the day on
which was to be celebrated the
comic-mimic-lyric-lightning-change-dramatic spectacle, for which a
large and spacious theater had been erected in the middle of the
plaza.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At nine on the night of the 10th, the eve of the
fiesta, after a succulent dinner set before us by the <i>hermano
mayor</i>, the attention of all the Spaniards and friars in the
convento was attracted by strains of music from a surging multitude
which, with the noise of bombs and rockets, preceded by the leading
citizens of the town, came to the convento to escort us to the place
prepared and arranged for us that we might witness the spectacle. Such
a courteous offer we had to accept, although I should have preferred to
rest in the arms of Morpheus and repose my weary limbs, which were
aching, thanks to the joltings of the vehicle furnished us by the
gobernadorcillo of B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Accordingly we joined them and proceeded to look
for our companions, who were dining in the house, owned here by the
pious and wealthy Don Santiago de los Santos. The curate of the town,
the Very Reverend Fray Bernardo Salvi, and the Very Reverend Fray
Damaso Verdolagas, who is now by the special favor of Heaven recovered
from the suffering caused him by an impious hand, in company with the
Very Reverend Fray Hernando Sibyla and the virtuous curate of Tanawan,
with other Spaniards, were guests in the house of the Filipino Croesus.
There we had the good fortune of admiring not only the luxury and good
taste of the host, which are not usual among the natives, but also the
beauty of the charming and wealthy heiress, who showed herself to be a
polished disciple of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Cecelia by
playing on her elegant piano, with a mastery that recalled Galvez to
me, the best German and Italian compositions. It is a matter of regret
that such a charming young lady should be so excessively modest as to
hide her talents from a society which has only admiration for her. Nor
should I leave unwritten that in the house of our host there were set
before us champagne and fine liqueurs with the profusion and splendor
that characterize the well-known capitalist.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We attended the spectacle. You already know our
artists, Ratia, Carvajal, and Fernandez, whose cleverness was
comprehended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5376" href="#xd24e5376"
name="xd24e5376">220</a>]</span>by us alone, since the uncultured crowd
did not understand a jot of it. Chananay and Balbino were very good,
though a little hoarse; the latter made one break, but together, and as
regards earnest effort, they were admirable. The Indians were greatly
pleased with the Tagalog drama, especially the gobernadorcillo, who
rubbed his hands and informed us that it was a pity that they had not
made the princess join in combat with the giant who had stolen her
away, which in his opinion would have been more marvelous, especially
if the giant had been represented as vulnerable only in the navel, like
a certain Ferragus of whom the stories of the Paladins tell. The Very
Reverend Fray Damaso, in his customary goodness of heart, concurred in
this opinion, and added that in such case the princess should be made
to discover the giant&rsquo;s weak spot and give him the <i>coup de
grace</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Needless to tell you that during the show the
affability of the Filipino Rothschild allowed nothing to be lacking:
ice-cream, lemonade, wines, and refreshments of all kinds circulated
profusely among us. A matter of reasonable and special note was the
absence of the well-known and cultured youth, Don Juan Crisostomo
Ibarra, who, as you know, will tomorrow preside at the laying of the
corner-stone for the great edifice which he is so philanthropically
erecting. This worthy descendant of the Pelayos and Elcanos (for I have
learned that one of his paternal ancestors was from our heroic and
noble northern provinces, perhaps one of the companions of Magellan or
Legazpi) did not show himself during the entire day, owing to a slight
indisposition. His name runs from mouth to mouth, being uttered with
praises that can only reflect glory upon Spain and true Spaniards like
ourselves, who never deny our blood, however mixed it may be.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Today, at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, we
attended a deeply-moving spectacle. Today, as is generally known, is
the fiesta of the Virgin of Peace and is being observed by the Brethren
of the Holy Rosary. Tomorrow will occur the fiesta of the patron, San
Diego, and it will be observed principally by the Venerable Tertiary
Order. Between these two societies there exists a pious rivalry in
serving God, which piety has reached the extreme of holy quarrels among
them, as has just happened in the dispute over the preacher of
acknowledged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5385" href="#xd24e5385"
name="xd24e5385">221</a>]</span>fame, the oft-mentioned Very Reverend
Fray Damaso, who tomorrow will occupy the pulpit of the Holy Ghost with
a sermon, which, according to general expectation, will be a literary
and religious event.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So, <i>as we were saying</i>, we attended a
highly edifying and moving spectacle. Six pious youths, three to recite
the mass and three for acolytes, marched out of the sacristy and
prostrated themselves before the altar, while the officiating priest,
the Very Reverend Fray Hernando Sibyla, chanted the <i>Surge
Domine</i>&mdash;the signal for commencing the procession around the
church&mdash;with the magnificent voice and religious unction that all
recognize and that make him so worthy of general admiration. When the
<i>Surge Domine</i> was concluded, the gobernadorcillo, in a frock
coat, carrying the standard and followed by four acolytes with
incense-burners, headed the procession. Behind them came the tall
silver candelabra, the municipal corporation, the precious images
dressed in satin and gold, representing <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Dominic and the Virgin of Peace in a
magnificent blue robe trimmed with gilded silver, the gift of the pious
ex-gobernadorcillo, the so-worthy-of-being-imitated and
never-sufficiently-praised Don Santiago de los Santos. All these images
were borne on silver cars. Behind the Mother of God came the Spaniards
and the rest of the clergy, while the officiating priest was protected
by a canopy carried by the cabezas de barangay, and the procession was
closed by a squad of the worthy Civil Guard. I believe it unnecessary
to state that a multitude of Indians, carrying lighted candles with
great devotion, formed the two lines of the procession. The musicians
played religious marches, while bombs and pinwheels furnished repeated
salutes. It causes admiration to see the modesty and the fervor which
these ceremonies inspire in the hearts of the true believers, the
grand, pure faith professed for the Virgin of Peace, the solemnity and
fervent devotion with which such ceremonies are performed by those of
us who have had the good fortune to be born under the sacrosanct and
immaculate banner of Spain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The procession concluded, there began the mass
rendered by the orchestra and the theatrical artists. After the reading
of the Gospel, the Very Reverend Fray Manuel Martin, an Augustinian
from the province of Batangas, ascended the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5403" href="#xd24e5403" name=
"xd24e5403">222</a>]</span>pulpit and kept the whole audience
enraptured and hanging on his words, especially the Spaniards, during
the exordium in Castilian, as he spoke with vigor and in such flowing
and well-rounded periods that our hearts were filled with fervor and
enthusiasm. This indeed is the term that should be used for what is
felt, or what we feel, when the Virgin of our beloved Spain is
considered, and above all when there can be intercalated in the text,
if the subject permits, the ideas of a prince of the Church, the
<i>Se&ntilde;or Monescillo</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5408src"
href="#xd24e5408" name="xd24e5408src">2</a> which are surely those of
all Spaniards.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At the conclusion of the services all of us went
up into the convento with the leading citizens of the town and other
persons of note. There we were especially honored by the refinement,
attention, and prodigality that characterize the Very Reverend Fray
Salvi, there being set before us cigars and an abundant lunch which the
<i lang="es">hermano mayor</i> had prepared under the convento for all
who might feel the necessity for appeasing the cravings of their
stomachs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;During the day nothing has been lacking to make
the fiesta joyous and to preserve the animation so characteristic of
Spaniards, and which it is impossible to restrain on such occasions as
this, showing itself sometimes in singing and dancing, at other times
in simple and merry diversions of so strong and noble a nature that all
sorrow is driven away, and it is enough for three Spaniards to be
gathered together in one place in order that sadness and ill-humor be
banished thence. Then homage was paid to Terpsichore in many homes, but
especially in that of the cultured Filipino millionaire, where we were
all invited to dine. Needless to say, the banquet, which was sumptuous
and elegantly served, was a second edition of the wedding-feast in
Cana, or of Camacho,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5418src" href=
"#xd24e5418" name="xd24e5418src">3</a> corrected and enlarged. While we
were enjoying the meal, which was directed by a cook from &lsquo;La
Campana,&rsquo; an orchestra played harmonious melodies. The beautiful
young lady of the house, in a mestiza <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5424" href="#xd24e5424" name=
"xd24e5424">223</a>]</span>gown<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5426src"
href="#xd24e5426" name="xd24e5426src">4</a> and a cascade of diamonds,
was as ever the queen of the feast.. All of us deplored from the bottom
of our hearts a light sprain in her shapely foot that deprived her of
the pleasures of the dance, for if we have to judge by her other
conspicuous perfections, the young lady must dance like a sylph.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alcalde of the province arrived this
afternoon for the purpose of honoring with his presence the ceremony of
tomorrow. He has expressed regret over the poor health of the
distinguished landlord, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, who in God&rsquo;s mercy
is now, according to report, somewhat recovered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tonight there was a solemn procession, but of
that I will speak in my letter tomorrow, because in addition to the
explosions that have bewildered me and made me somewhat deaf I am tired
and falling over with sleep. While, therefore, I recover my strength in
the arms of Morpheus&mdash;or rather on a cot in the convento&mdash;I
desire for you, my distinguished friend, a pleasant night and take
leave of you until tomorrow, which will be the great day.</p>
<p class="par">Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p class="par">SAN DIEGO, November 11.</p>
<p class="par">THE CORRESPONDENT.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Thus wrote the worthy correspondent. Now let us see what
Capitan Martin wrote to his friend, Luis Chiquito:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;DEAR CHOY,&mdash;Come a-running if you can,
for there&rsquo;s something doing at the fiesta. Just imagine, Capitan
Joaquin is almost broke. Capitan Tiago has doubled up on him three
times and won at the first turn of the cards each time, so that Capitan
Manuel, the owner of the house, is growing smaller every minute from
sheer joy. Padre Damaso smashed a lamp with his fist because up to now
he hasn&rsquo;t won on a single card. The Consul has lost on his cocks
and in the bank all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5458" href=
"#xd24e5458" name="xd24e5458">224</a>]</span>that he won from us at the
fiesta of Bi&ntilde;an and at that of the Virgin of the Pillar in Santa
Cruz.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We expected Capitan Tiago to bring us his future
son-in-law, the rich heir of Don Rafael, but it seems that he wishes to
imitate his father, for he does not even show himself. It&rsquo;s a
pity, for it seems he never will be any use to us.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Carlos the Chinaman is making a big fortune with
the <i>liam-p&oacute;</i>. I suspect that he carries something hidden,
probably a charm, for he complains constantly of headaches and keeps
his head bandaged, and when the wheel of the <i>liam-p&oacute;</i> is
slowing down he leans over, almost touching it, as if he were looking
at it closely. I am shocked, because I know more stories of the same
kind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good-by, Choy. My birds are well and my wife is
happy and having a good time.</p>
<p class="par">Your friend,</p>
<p class="par">MARTIN ARISTORENAS.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Ibarra had received a perfumed note which Andeng, Maria
Clara&rsquo;s foster-sister, delivered to him on the evening of the
first day of the fiesta. This note said:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;CRISOSTOMO,&mdash;It has been over a day
since you have shown yourself. I have heard that you are ill and have
prayed for you and lighted two candles, although papa says that you are
not seriously ill. Last night and today I&rsquo;ve been bored by
requests to play on the piano and by invitations to dance. I
didn&rsquo;t know before that there are so many tiresome people in the
world! If it were not for Padre Damaso, who tries to entertain me by
talking to me and telling me many things, I would have shut myself up
in my room and gone to sleep. Write me what the matter is with you and
I&rsquo;ll tell papa to visit you. For the present I send Andeng to
make you some tea, as she knows how to prepare it well, probably better
than your servants do.</p>
<p class="par">MARIA CLARA.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;P.S. If you don&rsquo;t come tomorrow, I
won&rsquo;t go to the ceremony. <i>Vale!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">The Morning</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At the first flush of dawn bands of music awoke
the tired people of the town with lively airs. Life and movement
reawakened, the bells began to chime, and the explosions commenced. It
was the last day of the fiesta, in fact the fiesta proper. Much was
hoped for, even more than on the previous day. The Brethren of the
Venerable Tertiary Order were more numerous than those of the Holy
Rosary, so they smiled piously, secure that they would humiliate their
rivals. They had purchased a greater number of tapers, wherefor the
Chinese dealers had reaped a harvest and in gratitude were thinking of
being baptized, although some remarked that this was not so much on
account of their faith in Catholicism as from a desire to get a wife.
To this the pious women answered, &ldquo;Even so, the marriage of so
many Chinamen at once would be little short of a miracle and their
wives would convert them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The people arrayed themselves in their best clothes and
dragged out from their strong-boxes all their jewelry. The sharpers and
gamblers all shone in embroidered camisas with large diamond studs,
heavy gold chains, and white straw hats. Only the old Sage went his way
as usual in his dark-striped sinamay camisa buttoned up to the neck,
loose shoes, and wide gray felt hat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You look sadder than ever!&rdquo; the
teniente-mayor accosted him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want us to be happy
now and then, since we have so much to weep over?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To be happy doesn&rsquo;t mean to act the
fool,&rdquo; answered the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the senseless orgy
of every year! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5504" href=
"#xd24e5504" name="xd24e5504">226</a>]</span>And all for no end but to
squander money, when there is so much misery and want. Yes, I
understand it all, it&rsquo;s the same orgy, the revel to drown the
woes of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know that I share your opinion,
though,&rdquo; replied Don Filipo, half jestingly and half in earnest.
&ldquo;I have defended it, but what can one do against the
gobernadorcillo and the curate?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; was the old man&rsquo;s curt
answer as he moved away.</p>
<p class="par">Don Filipo stood perplexed, staring after the old man.
&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; he muttered as he made his way toward the church.
&ldquo;Resign! Yes, if this office were an honor and not a burden, yes,
I would resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The paved court in front of the church was filled with
people; men and women, young and old, dressed in their best clothes,
all crowded together, came and went through the wide doors. There was a
smell of powder, of flowers, of incense, and of perfumes, while bombs,
rockets, and serpent-crackers made the women run and scream, the
children laugh. One band played in front of the convento, another
escorted the town officials, and still others marched about the
streets, where floated and waved a multitude of banners. Variegated
colors and lights distracted the sight, melodies and explosions the
hearing, while the bells kept up a ceaseless chime. Moving all about
were carriages whose horses at times became frightened, frisked and
reared all of which, while not included in the program of the fiesta,
formed a show in itself, free and by no means the least
entertaining.</p>
<p class="par">The <i>hermano mayor</i> for this day had sent servants
to seek in the streets for whomsoever they might invite, as did he who
gave the feast of which the Gospel tells us. Almost by force were urged
invitations to partake of chocolate, coffee, tea, and sweetmeats, these
invitations not seldom reaching the proportions of a demand.</p>
<p class="par">There was to be celebrated the high mass, that known as
the dalmatic, like the one of the day before, about which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5522" href="#xd24e5522" name=
"xd24e5522">227</a>]</span>the worthy correspondent wrote, only that
now the officiating priest was to be Padre Salvi, and that the alcalde
of the province, with many other Spaniards and persons of note, was to
attend it in order to hear Padre Damaso, who enjoyed a great reputation
in the province. Even the alferez, smarting under the preachments of
Padre Salvi, would also attend in order to give evidence of his
good-will and to recompense himself, if possible, for the bad spells
the curate had caused him.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the reputation of Padre Damaso that the
correspondent wrote beforehand to the editor of his newspaper:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As was announced in my badly executed account of
yesterday, so it has come to pass. We have had the especial pleasure of
listening to the Very Reverend Fray Damaso Verdolagas, former curate of
this town, recently transferred to a larger parish in recognition of
his meritorious services. The illustrious and holy orator occupied the
pulpit of the Holy Ghost and preached a most eloquent and profound
sermon, which edified and left marveling all the faithful who had
waited so anxiously to see spring from his fecund lips the restoring
fountain of eternal life. Sublimity of conception, boldness of
imagination, novelty of phraseology, gracefulness of style, naturalness
of gestures, cleverness of speech, vigor of ideas&mdash;these are the
traits of the Spanish Bossuet, who has justly earned such a high
reputation not only among the enlightened Spaniards but even among the
rude Indians and the cunning sons of the Celestial Empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the confiding correspondent almost saw himself
obliged to erase what he had written. Padre Damaso complained of a cold
that he had contracted the night before, for after singing a few merry
songs he had eaten three plates of ice-cream and attended the show for
a short time. As a result of all this, he wished to renounce his part
as the spokesman of God to men, but as no one else was to be found who
was so well versed in the life and miracles of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5530" href="#xd24e5530" name=
"xd24e5530">228</a>]</span>San Diego,&mdash;the curate knew them, it is
true, but it was his place to celebrate mass,&mdash;the other priests
unanimously declared that the tone of Padre Damaso&rsquo;s voice could
not be improved upon and that it would be a great pity for him to
forego delivering such an eloquent sermon as he had written and
memorized. Accordingly, his former housekeeper prepared for him
lemonade, rubbed his chest and neck with liniment and olive-oil,
massaged him, and wrapped him in warm cloths. He drank some raw eggs
beaten up in wine and for the whole morning neither talked nor
breakfasted, taking only a glass of milk and a cup of chocolate with a
dozen or so of crackers, heroically renouncing his usual fried chicken
and half of a Laguna cheese, because the housekeeper affirmed that
cheese contained salt and grease, which would aggravate his cough.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All for the sake of meriting heaven and of
converting us!&rdquo; exclaimed the Tertiary Sisters, much affected,
upon being informed of these sacrifices.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May Our Lady of Peace punish him!&rdquo; muttered
the Sisters of the Holy Rosary, unable to forgive him for leaning to
the side of their rivals.</p>
<p class="par">At half past eight the procession started from the
shadow of the canvas canopy. It was the same as that of the previous
day but for the introduction of one novelty: the older members of the
Venerable Tertiary Order and some maidens dressed as old women
displayed long gowns, the poor having them of coarse cloth and the rich
of silk, or rather of Franciscan <i>guing&oacute;n</i>, as it is
called, since it is most used by the reverend Franciscan friars. All
these sacred garments were genuine, having come from the convento in
Manila, where the people may obtain them as alms at a fixed price, if a
commercial term may be permitted; this fixed price was liable to
increase but not to reduction. In the convento itself and in the
nunnery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara<a class="noteref"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5552" href="#xd24e5552" name=

besides the special merit of gaining many indulgences for those who may
be shrouded in them, the very special merit of being dearer in
proportion as they are old, threadbare, and unserviceable. We write
this in case any pious reader need such sacred relics&mdash;or any
cunning rag-picker of Europe wish to make a fortune by taking to the
Philippines a consignment of patched and grimy garments, since they are
valued at sixteen pesos or more, according to their more or less
tattered appearance.</p>
<p class="par">San Diego de Alcala was borne on a float adorned with
plates of repouss&eacute; silver. The saint, though rather thin, had an
ivory bust which gave him a severe and majestic mien, in spite of
abundant kingly bangs like those of the Negrito. His mantle was of
satin embroidered with gold.</p>
<p class="par">Our venerable father, <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis, followed the Virgin as on yesterday,
except that the priest under the canopy this time was Padre Salvi and
not the graceful Padre Sibyla, so refined in manner. But if the former
lacked a beautiful carriage he had more than enough unction, walking
half bent over with lowered eyes and hands crossed in mystic attitude.
The bearers of the canopy were the same cabezas de barangay, sweating
with satisfaction at seeing themselves at the same time
semi-sacristans, collectors of the tribute, redeemers of poor erring
humanity, and consequently Christs who were giving their blood for the
sins of others. The surpliced coadjutor went from float to float
carrying the censer, with the smoke from which he from time to time
regaled the nostrils of the curate, who then became even more serious
and grave.</p>
<p class="par">So the procession moved forward slowly and deliberately
to the sound of bombs, songs, and religious melodies let loose into the
air by bands of musicians that followed the floats. Meanwhile, the
<i>hermano mayor</i> distributed candles <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5566" href="#xd24e5566" name="xd24e5566">230</a>]</span>with such
zeal that many of the participants returned to their homes with light
enough for four nights of card-playing. Devoutly the curious spectators
knelt at the passage of the float of the Mother of God, reciting Credos
and Salves fervently. In front of a house in whose gaily decorated
windows were to be seen the alcalde, Capitan Tiago, Maria Clara, and
Ibarra, with various Spaniards and young ladies, the float was
detained. Padre Salvi happened to raise his eyes, but made not the
slightest movement that might have been taken for a salute or a
recognition of them. He merely stood erect, so that his cope fell over
his shoulders more gracefully and elegantly.</p>
<p class="par">In the street under the window was a young woman of
pleasing countenance, dressed in deep mourning, carrying in her arms a
young baby. She must have been a nursemaid only, for the child was
white and ruddy while she was brown and had hair blacker than jet. Upon
seeing the curate the tender infant held out its arms, laughed with the
laugh that neither causes nor is caused by sorrow, and cried out
stammeringly in the midst of a brief silence, &ldquo;Pa-pa! Papa!
Papa!&rdquo; The young woman shuddered, slapped her hand hurriedly over
the baby&rsquo;s mouth and ran away in dismay, with the baby
crying.</p>
<p class="par">Malicious ones winked at each other, and the Spaniards
who had witnessed the short scene smiled, while the natural pallor of
Padre Salvi changed to the hue of poppies. Yet the people were wrong,
for the curate was not acquainted with the woman at all, she being a
stranger in the town. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5573" href=

<h2 class="main">In the Church</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">From end to end the huge barn that men dedicate as
a home to the Creator of all existing things was filled with people.
Pushing, crowding, and crushing one another, the few who were leaving
and the many who were entering filled the air with exclamations of
distress. Even from afar an arm would be stretched out to dip the
fingers in the holy water, but at the critical moment the surging crowd
would force the hand away. Then would be heard a complaint, a trampled
woman would upbraid some one, but the pushing would continue. Some old
people might succeed in dipping their fingers in the water, now the
color of slime, where the population of a whole town, with transients
besides, had washed. With it they would anoint themselves devoutly,
although with difficulty, on the neck, on the crown of the head, on the
forehead, on the chin, on the chest, and on the abdomen, in the
assurance that thus they were sanctifying those parts and that they
would suffer neither stiff neck, headache, consumption, nor
indigestion. The young people, whether they were not so ailing or did
not believe in that holy prophylactic, hardly more than moistened the
tip of a finger&mdash;and this only in order that the devout might have
no cause to talk&mdash;and pretended to make the sign of the cross on
their foreheads, of course without touching them. &ldquo;It may be
blessed and everything you may wish,&rdquo; some young woman doubtless
thought, &ldquo;but it has such a color!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was difficult to breathe in the heat amid the smells
of the human animal, but the preacher was worth all these
inconveniences, as the sermon was costing the town two hundred
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5583" href="#xd24e5583" name=
"xd24e5583">232</a>]</span>and fifty pesos. Old Tasio had said:
&ldquo;Two hundred and fifty pesos for a sermon! One man on one
occasion! Only a third of what comedians cost, who will work for three
nights! Surely you must be very rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What has that to do with the drama?&rdquo;
testily inquired the nervous leader of the Tertiary Brethren.
&ldquo;With the drama souls go to hell but with the sermon to heaven!
If he had asked a thousand, we would have paid him and should still owe
him gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After all, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied the
Sage, &ldquo;for the sermon is more amusing to me at least than the
drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I am not amused even by the drama!&rdquo;
yelled the other furiously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe it, since you understand one about as
well as you do the other!&rdquo; And the impious old man moved away
without paying any attention to the insults and the direful prophecies
that the irritated leader offered concerning his future existence.</p>
<p class="par">While they were waiting for the alcalde, the people
sweated and yawned, agitating the air with fans, hats, and
handkerchiefs. Children shouted and cried, which kept the sacristans
busy putting them out of the sacred edifice. Such action brought to the
dull and conscientious leader of the Brotherhood of the Holy Rosary
this thought: &ldquo;&lsquo;Suffer little children to come unto
me,&rsquo; said Our Savior, it is true, but here must be understood,
children who do not cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">An old woman in a <i>guing&oacute;n</i> habit, Sister
Put&eacute;, chid her granddaughter, a child of six years, who was
kneeling at her side, &ldquo;O lost one, give heed, for you&rsquo;re
going to hear a sermon like that of Good Friday!&rdquo; Here the old
lady gave her a pinch to awaken the piety of the child, who made a
grimace, stuck out her nose, and wrinkled up her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="par">Some men squatted on their heels and dozed beside the
confessional. One old man nodding caused our old woman to believe that
he was mumbling prayers, so, running her fingers rapidly over the beads
of her rosary&mdash;as that was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5602" href="#xd24e5602" name="xd24e5602">233</a>]</span>the most
reverent way of respecting the designs of Heaven&mdash;little by little
she set herself to imitating hint.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra stood in one corner while Maria Clara knelt near
the high altar in a space which the curate had had the courtesy to
order the sacristans to clear for her. Capitan Tiago, in a frock coat,
sat on one of the benches provided for the authorities, which caused
the children who did not know him to take him for another
gobernadorcillo and to be wary about getting near him.</p>
<p class="par">At last the alcalde with his staff arrived, proceeding
from the sacristy and taking their seats in magnificent chairs placed
on strips of carpet. The alcalde wore a full-dress uniform and
displayed the cordon of Carlos III, with four or five other
decorations. The people did not recognize him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed a rustic.
&ldquo;A civil-guard dressed as a comedian!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; rejoined a bystander, nudging him
with his elbow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Prince Villardo that we saw at
the show last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the alcalde went up several degrees in the popular
estimation by becoming an enchanted prince, a vanquisher of giants.</p>
<p class="par">When the mass began, those who were seated arose and
those who had been asleep were awakened by the ringing of the bells and
the sonorous voices of the singers. Padre Salvi, in spite of his
gravity, wore a look of deep satisfaction, since there were serving him
as deacon and subdeacon none less than two Augustinians. Each one, as
it came his turn, sang well, in a more or less nasal tone and with
unintelligible articulation, except the officiating priest himself,
whose voice trembled somewhat, even getting out of tune at times, to
the great wonder of those who knew him. Still he moved about with
precision and elegance while he recited the <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>
unctuously, dropping his head a little to the side and gazing toward
heaven. Seeing him receive the smoke from the incense one would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5623" href="#xd24e5623" name=
"xd24e5623">234</a>]</span>have said that Galen was right in averring
the passage of smoke in the nasal canals to the head through a screen
of ethmoids, since he straightened himself, threw his head back, and
moved toward the middle of the altar with such pompousness and gravity
that Capitan Tiago found him more majestic than the Chinese comedian of
the night before, even though the latter had been dressed as an
emperor, paint-bedaubed, with beribboned sword, stiff beard like a
horse&rsquo;s mane, and high-soled slippers. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo;
so his thoughts ran, &ldquo;a single curate of ours has more majesty
than all the emperors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At length came the expected moment, that of hearing
Padre Damaso. The three priests seated themselves in their chairs in an
edifying attitude, as the worthy correspondent would say, the alcalde
and other persons of place and position following their example. The
music ceased.</p>
<p class="par">The sudden transition from noise to silence awoke our
aged Sister Put&eacute;, who was already snoring under cover of the
music. Like Segismundo,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5629src" href=
"#xd24e5629" name="xd24e5629src">1</a> or like the cook in the story of
the Sleeping Beauty, the first thing that she did upon awaking was to
whack her granddaughter on the neck, as the child had also fallen
asleep. The latter screamed, but soon consoled herself at the sight of
a woman who was beating her breast with contrition and enthusiasm. All
tried to place themselves comfortably, those who had no benches
squatting down on the floor or on their heels.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Damaso passed through the congregation preceded by
two sacristans and followed by another friar carrying a massive volume.
He disappeared as he went up the winding staircase, but his round head
soon reappeared, then his fat neck, followed immediately by his body.
Coughing slightly, he looked about him with assurance. He noticed
Ibarra and with a special wink gave to understand that he would not
overlook that youth in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5640" href=
"#xd24e5640" name="xd24e5640">235</a>]</span>his prayers. Then he
turned a look of satisfaction upon Padre Sibyla and another of disdain
upon Padre Martin, the preacher of the previous day. This inspection
concluded, he turned cautiously and said, &ldquo;Attention,
brother!&rdquo; to his companion, who opened the massive volume.</p>
<p class="par">But the sermon deserves a separate chapter. A young man
who was then learning stenography and who idolizes great orators, took
it down; thanks to this fact, we can here present a selection from the
sacred oratory of those regions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Fray Damaso began slowly in a low voice:
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="la">Et spiritum <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e5654" title="Not in source">tuum</span> bonum dedisti, qui
doceret eos, et manna tuum non prohibuisti ab ore eorum, et aquam
dedisti eis in siti</i>. And thou gavest thy good Spirit to teach them,
and thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest
them water for their thirst!&rsquo; Words which the Lord spoke through
the mouth of Esdras, in the second book, the ninth chapter, and the
twentieth verse.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5658src" href=
"#xd24e5658" name="xd24e5658src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Padre Sibyla glanced in surprise at the preacher. Padre
Manuel Martin turned pale and swallowed hard that was better than his!
Whether Padre Damaso noticed this or whether he was still hoarse, the
fact is that he coughed several times as he placed both hands on the
rail of the pulpit. The Holy Ghost was above his head, freshly painted,
clean and white, with rose-colored beak and feet. &ldquo;Most honorable
sir&rdquo; (to the alcalde), &ldquo;most holy priests, Christians,
brethren in Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here he made a solemn pause as again he swept his gaze
over the congregation, with whose attention and concentration he seemed
satisfied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The first part of the sermon is to be in Spanish
and the other in Tagalog; <i lang="la">loquebantur omnes
linguas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After the salutations and the pause he extended his
right hand majestically toward the altar, at the same time fixing his
gaze on the alcalde. He slowly crossed his arms without uttering a
word, then suddenly passing from calmness to action, threw back his
head and made a sign toward the main door, sawing the air with his open
hand so forcibly that the sacristans interpreted the gesture as a
command <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5672" href="#xd24e5672"
name="xd24e5672">237</a>]</span>and closed the doors. The alferez
became uneasy, doubting whether he should go or stay, when the preacher
began in a strong voice, full and sonorous; truly his old housekeeper
was skilled in medicine.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Radiant and resplendent is the altar, wide is the
great door, the air is the vehicle of the holy and divine words that
will spring from my mouth! Hear ye then with the ears of your souls and
hearts that the words of the Lord may not fall on the stony soil where
the birds of Hell may consume them, but that ye may grow and flourish
as holy seed in the field of our venerable and seraphic father,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis! O ye great sinners,
captives of the Moros of the soul that infest the sea of eternal life
in the powerful craft of the flesh and the world, ye who are laden with
the fetters of lust and avarice, and who toil in the galleys of the
infernal Satan, look ye here with reverent repentance upon him who
saved souls from the captivity of the devil, upon the intrepid Gideon,
upon the valiant David, upon the triumphant Roland of Christianity,
upon the celestial Civil Guard, more powerful than all the Civil Guards
together, now existing or to exist!&rdquo; (The alferez frowned.)
&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or alferez, more valiant and powerful, he who
with no other weapon than a wooden cross boldly vanquishes the eternal
tulisan of the shades and all the hosts of Lucifer, and who would have
exterminated them forever, were not the spirits immortal! This marvel
of divine creation, this wonderful prodigy, is the blessed Diego of
Alcala, who, if I may avail myself of a comparison, since comparisons
aid in the comprehension of incomprehensible things, as another has
said, I say then that this great saint is merely a private soldier, a
steward in the powerful company which our seraphic father, <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis, sends from Heaven, and to which I have
the honor to belong as a corporal or sergeant, by the grace of
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;rude Indians,&rdquo; as the correspondent
would say, caught nothing more from this paragraph than the words
&ldquo;Civil Guard,&rdquo; &ldquo;tulisan,&rdquo; &ldquo;San
Diego,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5687" href="#xd24e5687" name="xd24e5687">238</a>]</span>so,
observing the wry face of the alferez and the bellicose gestures of the
preacher, they deduced that the latter was reprehending him for not
running down the tulisanes. San Diego and <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis would be commissioned in this duty and
justly so, as is proved by a picture existing in the convento at
Manila, representing <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis, by
means of his girdle only, holding back the Chinese invasion in the
first years after the discovery. The devout were accordingly not a
little rejoiced and thanked God for this aid, not doubting that once
the tulisanes had disappeared, <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis would also destroy the Civil Guard.
With redoubled attention, therefore, they listened to Padre Damaso, as
he continued:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Most honorable sir: Great affairs are great
affairs even by the side of the small and the small are always small
even by the side of the great. So History says, but since History hits
the nail on the head only once in a hundred times, being a thing made
by men, and men make mistakes&mdash;<i>errarle es hominum</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5703src" href="#xd24e5703" name="xd24e5703src">2</a>
as Cicero said&mdash;he who opens his mouth makes mistakes, as they say
in my country then the result is that there are profound truths which
History does not record. These truths, most honorable sir, the divine
Spirit spoke with that supreme wisdom which human intelligence has not
comprehended since the times of Seneca and Aristotle, those wise
priests of antiquity, even to our sinful days, and these truths are
that not always are small affairs small, but that they are great, not
by the side of the little things, but by the side of the grandest of
the earth and of the heavens and of the air and of the clouds and of
the waters and of space and of life and of death!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; exclaimed the leader of the
Tertiaries, crossing himself.</p>
<p class="par">With this figure of rhetoric, which he had learned from
a famous preacher in Manila, Padre Damaso wished to startle his
audience, and in fact his holy ghost was so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5711" href="#xd24e5711" name=
"xd24e5711">239</a>]</span>fascinated with such great truths that it
was necessary to kick him to remind him of his business.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Patent to your eyes&mdash;&rdquo; prompted the
holy ghost below.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Patent to your eyes is the conclusive and
impressive proof of this eternal philosophical truth! Patent is that
sun of virtue, and I say sun and not moon, for there is no great merit
in the fact that the moon shines during the night,&mdash;in the land of
the blind the one-eyed man is king; by night may shine a light, a tiny
star,&mdash;so the greatest merit is to be able to shine even in the
middle of the day, as the sun does; so shines our brother Diego even in
the midst of the greatest saints! Here you have patent to your eyes, in
your impious disbelief, the masterpiece of the Highest for the
confusion of the great of the earth, yes, my brethren, patent,
<i>patent</i> to all, PATENT!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A man rose pale and trembling and hid himself in a
confessional. He was a liquor dealer who had been dozing and dreaming
that the carbineers were demanding the patent, or license, that he did
not have. It may safely be affirmed that he did not come out from his
hiding-place while the sermon lasted.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Humble and lowly saint, thy wooden cross&rdquo;
(the one that the image held was of silver), &ldquo;thy modest gown,
honors the great Francis whose sons and imitators we are. We propagate
thy holy race in the whole world, in the remote places, in the cities,
in the towns, without distinction between black and white&rdquo; (the
alcalde held his breath), &ldquo;suffering hardships and martyrdoms,
thy holy race of faith and religion militant&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
breathed the alcalde) &ldquo;which holds the world in balance and
prevents it from falling into the depths of perdition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His hearers, including even Capitan Tiago, yawned little
by little. Maria Clara was not listening to the sermon, for she knew
that Ibarra was near and was thinking about him while she fanned
herself and gazed at an evangelical bull that had all the outlines of a
small carabao.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5727" href=
"#xd24e5727" name="xd24e5727">240</a>]</span>&ldquo;All should know by
heart the Holy Scriptures and the lives of the saints and then I should
not have to preach to you, O sinners! You should know such important
and necessary things as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, although many of you
have forgotten it, living now as do the Protestants or heretics, who,
like the Chinese, respect not the ministers of God. But the worse for
you, O ye accursed, moving as you are toward damnation!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;</i>, Pale Lamaso,
what!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5734src" href="#xd24e5734"
name="xd24e5734src">3</a> muttered Carlos, the Chinese, looking angrily
at the preacher, who continued to extemporize, emitting a series of
apostrophes and imprecations.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will die in final unrepentance, O race of
heretics! God punishes you even on this earth with jails and prisons!
Women should flee from you, the rulers should hang all of you so that
the seed of Satan be not multiplied in the vineyard of the Lord! Jesus
Christ said: &lsquo;If you have an evil member that leads you to sin,
cut it off, and cast it into the fire&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Having forgotten both his sermon and his rhetoric, Fray
Damaso began to be nervous. Ibarra became uneasy and looked about for a
quiet corner, but the church was crowded. Maria Clara neither heard nor
saw anything as she was analyzing a picture, of the blessed souls in
purgatory, souls in the shape of men and women dressed in hides, with
miters, hoods, and cowls, all roasting in the fire and clutching
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis&rsquo; girdle, which did
not break even with such great weight. With that improvisation on the
preacher&rsquo;s part, the holy-ghost friar lost the thread of the
sermon and skipped over three long paragraphs, giving the wrong cue to
the now laboriously-panting Fray Damaso.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who of you, O sinners, would lick the sores of a
poor and ragged beggar? Who? Let him answer by raising his hand! None!
That I knew, for only a saint like Diego de Alcala would do it. He
licked all the sores, saying to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5746" href="#xd24e5746" name="xd24e5746">241</a>]</span>an
astonished brother, &lsquo;Thus is this sick one cured!&rsquo; O
Christian charity! O matchless example! O virtue of virtues! O
inimitable pattern! O spotless talisman!&rdquo; Here he continued a
long series of exclamations, the while crossing his arms and raising
and lowering them as though he wished to fly or to frighten the birds
away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Before dying he spoke in Latin, without knowing
Latin! Marvel, O sinners! You, in spite of what you study, for which
blows are given to you, you do not speak Latin, and you will die
without speaking it! To speak Latin is a gift of God and therefore the
Church uses Latin! I, too, speak Latin! Was God going to deny this
consolation to His beloved Diego? Could he die, could he be permitted
to die, without speaking Latin? Impossible! God wouldn&rsquo;t be just,
He Wouldn&rsquo;t be God! So he talked in Latin, and of that fact the
writers of his time bear witness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He ended this exordium with the passage which had cost
him the most toil and which he had plagiarized from a great writer,
Sinibaldo de Mas. &ldquo;Therefore, I salute thee, illustrious Diego,
the glory of our Order! Thou art the pattern of virtue, meek with
honor, humble with nobility, compliant with fortitude, temperate with
ambition, hostile with loyalty, compassionate with pardon, holy with
conscientiousness, full of faith with devotion, credulous with
sincerity, chaste with love, reserved with secrecy; long-suffering with
patience, brave with timidity, moderate with desire, bold with
resolution, obedient with subjection., modest with pride, zealous with
disinterestedness, skilful with capability, ceremonious with
politeness, astute with sagacity, merciful with piety, secretive with
modesty, revengeful with valor, poor on account of thy labors with true
conformity, prodigal with economy, active with ease, economical with
liberality, innocent with sagacity, reformer with consistency,
indifferent with zeal for learning: God created thee to feel the
raptures of Platonic love! Aid me in singing thy greatness and thy name
higher than the stars <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5753" href=
"#xd24e5753" name="xd24e5753">242</a>]</span>and clearer than the sun
itself that circles about thy feet! Aid me, all of you, as you appeal
to God for sufficient inspiration by reciting the Ave Maria!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All fell upon their knees and raised a murmur like the
humming of a thousand bees. The alcalde laboriously bent one knee and
wagged his head in a disgusted manner, while the alferez looked pale
and penitent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the devil with the curate!&rdquo; muttered one
of two youths who had come from Manila.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Keep still!&rdquo; admonished his companion.
&ldquo;His woman might hear us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, Padre Damaso, instead of reciting the Ave
Maria, was scolding his holy ghost for having skipped three of his best
paragraphs; at the same time he consumed a couple of cakes and a glass
of Malaga, secure of encountering therein greater inspiration than in
all the holy ghosts, whether of wood in the form of a dove or of flesh
in the shape of an inattentive friar.</p>
<p class="par">Then he began the sermon in Tagalog. The devout old
woman again gave her granddaughter a hearty slap. The child awoke
ill-naturedly and asked, &ldquo;Is it time to cry now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not yet, O lost one, but don&rsquo;t go to sleep
again!&rdquo; answered the good grandmother.</p>
<p class="par">Of the second part of the sermon&mdash;that in
Tagalog&mdash;we have only a few rough notes, for Padre Damaso
extemporized in this language, not because he knew it better, but
because, holding the provincial Filipinos ignorant of rhetoric, he was
not afraid of making blunders before them. With Spaniards the case was
different; he had heard rules of oratory spoken of, and it was possible
that among his hearers some one had been in college-halls, perhaps the
alcalde, so he wrote out his sermons, corrected and polished them, and
then memorized and rehearsed them for several days beforehand.</p>
<p class="par">It is common knowledge that none of those present
understood the drift of the sermon. They were so dull of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5771" href="#xd24e5771" name=
"xd24e5771">243</a>]</span>understanding and the preacher was so
profound, as Sister Rufa said, that the audience waited in vain for an
opportunity to weep, and the lost grandchild of the blessed old woman
went to sleep again. Nevertheless, this part had greater consequences
than the first, at least for certain hearers, as we shall see
later.</p>
<p class="par">He began with a &ldquo;<i>Mana capatir con
cristiano</i>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5778src" href=
"#xd24e5778" name="xd24e5778src">4</a> followed by an avalanche of
untranslatable phrases. He talked of the soul, of Hell, of
&ldquo;<i>mahal na santo pintacasi</i>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e5784src" href="#xd24e5784" name="xd24e5784src">5</a> of the
Indian sinners and of the virtuous Franciscan Fathers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the two
irreverent Manilans to his companion. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all Greek to
me. I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo; Seeing the doors closed, he went out
through the sacristy, to the great scandal of the people and especially
of the preacher, who turned pale and paused in the midst of his
sentence. Some looked for a violent apostrophe, but Padre Damaso
contented himself with watching the delinquent, and then he went on
with his sermon.</p>
<p class="par">Then were let loose curses upon the age, against the
lack of reverence, against the growing indifference to Religion. This
matter seemed to be his forte, for he appeared to be inspired and
expressed himself with force and clearness. He talked of the sinners
who did not attend confession, who died in prisons without the
sacraments, of families accursed, of proud and puffed-up little
half-breeds, of young sages and little philosophers, of pettifoggers,
of picayunish students, and so on. Well known is this habit that many
have when they wish to ridicule their enemies; they apply to them
belittling epithets because their brains do not appear to furnish them
any other means, and thus they are happy.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra heard it all and understood the allusions.
Preserving an outward calm, he turned his eyes to God and the
authorities, but saw nothing more than the images of saints, and the
alcalde was sleeping.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5795" href=
"#xd24e5795" name="xd24e5795">244</a>]</span>Meanwhile, the
preacher&rsquo;s enthusiasm was rising by degrees. He spoke of the
times when every Filipino upon meeting a priest took off his hat, knelt
on the ground, and kissed the priest&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;But
now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you only take off your salakot or your
felt hat, which you have placed on the side of your head in order not
to ruffle your nicely combed hair! You content yourself with saying,
&lsquo;good day, <i>among</i>,&rsquo; and there are proud dabblers in a
little Latin who, from having studied in Manila or in Europe, believe
that they have the right to shake a priest&rsquo;s hand instead of
kissing it. Ah, the day of judgment will quickly come, the world will
end, as many saints have foretold; it will rain fire, stones, and ashes
to chastise your pride!&rdquo; The people were exhorted not to imitate
such &ldquo;savages&rdquo; but to hate and shun them, since they were
beyond the religious pale.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hear what the holy decrees say! When an Indian
meets a curate in the street he should bow his head and offer his neck
for his master to step upon. If the curate and the Indian are both on
horseback, then the Indian should stop and take off his hat or salakot
reverently; and finally, if the Indian is on horseback and the curate
on foot, the Indian should alight and not mount again until the curate
has told him to go on, or is far away. This is what the holy decrees
say and he who does not obey will be excommunicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And when one is riding a carabao?&rdquo; asked a
scrupulous countryman of his neighbor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then&mdash;keep on going!&rdquo; answered the
latter, who was a casuist.</p>
<p class="par">But in spite of the cries and gestures of the preacher
many fell asleep or wandered in their attention, since these sermons
were ever the same. In vain some devout women tried to sigh and sob
over the sins of the wicked; they had to desist in the attempt from
lack of supporters. Even Sister Put&eacute; was thinking of something
quite different. A man beside her had dropped off to sleep in such a
way that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5808" href="#xd24e5808"
name="xd24e5808">245</a>]</span>he had fallen over and crushed her
habit, so the good woman caught up one of her clogs and with blows
began to wake him, crying out, &ldquo;Get away, savage, brute, devil,
carabao, cur, accursed!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Naturally, this caused somewhat of a stir. The preacher
paused and arched his eyebrows, surprised at so great a scandal.
Indignation choked the words in his throat and he was able only to
bellow, while he pounded the pulpit with his fists. This had the
desired effect, however, for the old woman, though still grumbling,
dropped her clog and, crossing herself repeatedly, fell devoutly upon
her knees.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aaah! Aaah!&rdquo; the indignant priest was at
last able to roar out as he crossed his arms and shook his head.
&ldquo;For this do I preach to you the whole morning, savages! Here in
the house of God you quarrel and curse, shameless ones! Aaaah! You
respect nothing! This is the result of the luxury and the looseness of
the age! That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve told you, aah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Upon this theme he continued to preach for half an hour.
The alcalde snored, and Maria Clara nodded, for the poor child could no
longer keep from sleeping, since she had no more paintings or images to
study, nor anything else to amuse her. On Ibarra the words and
allusions made no more impression, for he was thinking of a cottage on
the top of a mountain and saw Maria Clara in the garden; let men crawl
about in their miserable towns in the depths of the valley!</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi had caused the altar bell to be rung twice,
but this was only adding fuel to the flame, for Padre Damaso became
stubborn and prolonged the sermon. Fray Sibyla gnawed at his lips and
repeatedly adjusted his gold-mounted eye-glasses. Fray Manuel Martin
was the only one who appeared to listen with pleasure, for he was
smiling.</p>
<p class="par">But at last God said &ldquo;Enough&rdquo;; the orator
became weary and descended from the pulpit. All knelt to render
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5821" href="#xd24e5821" name=
"xd24e5821">246</a>]</span>thanks to God. The alcalde rubbed his eyes,
stretched out one arm as if to waken himself, and yawned with a deep
<i>aah</i>. The mass continued.</p>
<p class="par">When all were kneeling and the priests had lowered their
heads while the <i>Incarnatus est</i> was being sung, a man murmured in
Ibarra&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;At the laying of the cornerstone,
don&rsquo;t move away from the curate, don&rsquo;t go down into the
trench, don&rsquo;t go near the stone&mdash;your life depends upon
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra turned to see Elias, who, as soon as he had said
this, disappeared in the crowd. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Derrick</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The yellowish individual had kept his word, for it
was no simple derrick that he had erected above the open trench to let
the heavy block of granite down into its place. It was not the simple
tripod that &Ntilde;or Juan had wanted for suspending a pulley from its
top, but was much more, being at once a machine and an ornament, a
grand and imposing ornament. Over eight meters in height rose the
confused and complicated scaffolding. Four thick posts sunk in the
ground served as a frame, fastened to each other by huge timbers
crossing diagonally and joined by large nails driven in only half-way,
perhaps for the reason that the apparatus was simply for temporary use
and thus might easily be taken down again. Huge cables stretched from
all sides gave an appearance of solidity and grandeur to the whole. At
the top it was crowned with many-colored banners, streaming pennants,
and enormous garlands of flowers and leaves artistically
interwoven.</p>
<p class="par">There at the top in the shadow made by the posts, the
garlands, and the banners, hung fastened with cords and iron hooks an
unusually large three-wheeled pulley over the polished sides of which
passed in a crotch three cables even larger than the others. These held
suspended the smooth, massive stone hollowed out in the center to form
with a similar hole in the lower stone, already in place, the little
space intended to contain the records of contemporaneous history, such
as newspapers, manuscripts, money, medals, and the like, and perhaps to
transmit them to very remote generations. The cables extended downward
and connected with another equally large pulley at the bottom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5843" href="#xd24e5843" name=
"xd24e5843">248</a>]</span>of the apparatus, whence they passed to the
drum of a windlass held in place by means of heavy timbers. This
windlass, which could be turned with two cranks, increased the strength
of a man a hundredfold by the movement of notched wheels, although it
is true that what was gained in force was lost in velocity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the yellowish individual,
turning the crank, &ldquo;look, &Ntilde;or Juan, how with merely my own
strength I can raise and lower the great stone. It&rsquo;s so well
arranged that at will I can regulate the rise or fall inch by inch, so
that a man in the trench can easily fit the stones together while I
manage it from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&Ntilde;or Juan could not but gaze in admiration at the
speaker, who was smiling in his peculiar way. Curious bystanders made
remarks praising the yellowish individual.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who taught you mechanics?&rdquo; asked &Ntilde;or
Juan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My father, my dead father,&rdquo; was the answer,
accompanied by his peculiar smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who taught your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Saturnino, the grandfather of Don
Crisostomo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Don
Saturnino&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, he knew a lot of things! He not only beat his
laborers well and exposed them out in the sun, but he also knew how to
wake the sleepers and put the waking to sleep. You&rsquo;ll see in time
what my father taught me, you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here the yellowish individual smiled again, but in a
strange way.</p>
<p class="par">On a tame covered with a piece of Persian tapestry
rested a leaden cylinder containing the objects that were to be kept in
the tomb-like receptacle and a glass case with thick sides, which would
hold that mummy of an epoch and preserve for the future the records of
a past.</p>
<p class="par">Tasio, the Sage, who was walking about there
thoughtfully, murmured: &ldquo;Perchance some day when this edifice,
which is today begun, has grown old and after many vicissitudes has
fallen into ruins, either from the visitations of Nature or the
destructive hand of man, and above <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5868" href="#xd24e5868" name="xd24e5868">249</a>]</span>the ruins
grow the ivy and the moss,&mdash;then when Time has destroyed the moss
and ivy, and scattered the ashes of the ruins themselves to the winds,
wiping from the pages of History the recollection of it and of those
who destroyed it, long since lost from the memory of man: perchance
when the races have been buried in their mantle of earth or have
disappeared, only by accident the pick of some miner striking a spark
from this rock will dig up mysteries and enigmas from the depths of the
soil. Perchance the learned men of the nation that dwells in these
regions will labor, as do the present Egyptologists, with the remains
of a great civilization which occupied itself with eternity, little
dreaming that upon it was descending so long a night. Perchance some
learned professor will say to his students of five or six years of age,
in a language spoken by all mankind, &lsquo;Gentlemen, after studying
and examining carefully the objects found in the depths of our soil,
after deciphering some symbols and translating a few words, we can
without the shadow of a doubt conclude that these objects belonged to
the barbaric age of man, to that obscure era which we are accustomed to
speak of as fabulous. In short, gentlemen, in order that you may form
an approximate idea of the backwardness of our ancestors, it will be
sufficient that I point out to you the fact that those who lived here
not only recognized kings, but also for the purpose of settling
questions of local government they had to go to the other side of the
earth, just as if we should say that a body in order to move itself
would need to consult a head existing in another part of the globe,
perhaps in regions now sunk under the waves. This incredible defect,
however improbable it may seem to us now, must have existed, if we take
into consideration the circumstances surrounding those beings, whom I
scarcely dare to call human! In those primitive times men were still
(or at least so they believed) in direct communication with their
Creator, since they had ministers from Him, beings different from the
rest, designated always with the mysterious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5870" href="#xd24e5870" name=
"xd24e5870">250</a>]</span>letters &ldquo;M. R. P.&rdquo;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e5872src" href="#xd24e5872" name="xd24e5872src">1</a>
concerning the meaning of which our learned men do not agree. According
to the professor of languages whom we have here, rather mediocre, since
he does not speak more than a hundred of the imperfect languages of the
past, &ldquo;M. R. P.&rdquo; may signify &ldquo;<i lang="es">Muy Rico
Propietario</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e5880src" href=
"#xd24e5880" name="xd24e5880src">2</a> These ministers were a species
of demigods, very virtuous and enlightened, and were very eloquent
orators, who, in spite of their great power and prestige, never
committed the slightest fault, which fact strengthens my belief in
supposing that they were of a nature distinct from the rest. If this
were not sufficient to sustain my belief, there yet remains the
argument, disputed by no one and day by day confirmed, that these
mysterious beings could make God descend to earth merely by saying a
few words, that God could speak only through their mouths, that they
ate His flesh and drank His blood, and even at times allowed the common
folk to do the same.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These and other opinions the skeptical Sage put into the
mouths of all the corrupt men of the future. Perhaps, as may easily be
the case, old Tasio was mistaken, but we must return to our story.</p>
<p class="par">In the kiosks which we saw two days ago occupied by the
schoolmaster and his pupils, there was now spread out a toothsome and
abundant meal. Noteworthy is the fact that on the table prepared for
the school children there was not a single bottle of wine but an
abundance of fruits. In the arbors joining the two kiosks were the
seats for the musicians and a table covered with sweetmeats and
confections, with bottles of water for the thirsty public, all
decorated with leaves and flowers. The schoolmaster had erected near by
a greased pole and hurdles, and had hung up pots and pans for a number
of games.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5891" href=
"#xd24e5891" name="xd24e5891">251</a>]</span>The crowd, resplendent in
bright-colored garments, gathered as people fled from the burning sun,
some into the shade of the trees, others under the arbor. The boys
climbed up into the branches or on the stones in order to see the
ceremony better, making up in this way for their short stature. They
looked with envy at the clean and well-dressed school children, who
occupied a place especially assigned to them and whose parents were
overjoyed, as they, poor country folk, would see their children eat
from a white tablecloth, almost the same as the curate or the alcalde.
Thinking of this alone was enough to drive away hunger, and such an
event would be recounted from father to son.</p>
<p class="par">Soon were heard the distant strains of the band, which
was preceded by a motley throng made up of persons of all ages, in
clothing of all colors. The yellowish individual became uneasy and with
a glance examined his whole apparatus. A curious countryman followed
his glance and watched all his movements; this was Elias, who had also
come to witness the ceremony, but in his salakot and rough attire he
was almost unrecognizable. He had secured a very good position almost
at the side of the windlass, on the edge of the excavation. With the
music came the alcalde, the municipal officials, the friars, with the
exception of Padre Damaso, and the Spanish employees. Ibarra was
conversing with the alcalde, of whom he had made quite a friend since
he had addressed to him some well-turned compliments over his
decorations and ribbons, for aristocratic pretensions were the weakness
of his Honor. Capitan Tiago, the alferez, and some other wealthy
personages came in the gilded cluster of maidens displaying their
silken parasols. Padre Salvi followed, silent and thoughtful as
ever.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Count upon my support always in any worthy
enterprise,&rdquo; the alcalde was saying to Ibarra. &ldquo;I will give
you whatever appropriation you need or else see that it is furnished by
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5898" href=
"#xd24e5898" name="xd24e5898">252</a>]</span>As they drew nearer the
youth felt his heart beat faster. Instinctively he glanced at the
strange scaffolding raised there. He saw the yellowish individual
salute him respectfully and gaze at him fixedly for a moment. With
surprise he noticed Elias, who with a significant wink gave him to
understand that he should remember the warning in the church.</p>
<p class="par">The curate put on his sacerdotal robes and commenced the
ceremony, while the one-eyed sacristan held the book and an acolyte the
hyssop and jar of holy water. The rest stood about him uncovered, and
maintained such a profound silence that, in spite of his reading in a
low tone, it was apparent that Padre Salvi&rsquo;s voice was
trembling.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, there had been placed in the glass case the
manuscripts, newspapers, medals, coins, and the like, and the whole
enclosed in the leaden cylinder, which was then hermetically
sealed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, will you put the box in its
place? The curate is waiting,&rdquo; murmured the alcalde into the
young man&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I would with great pleasure,&rdquo; answered the
latter, &ldquo;but that would be usurping the honorable duty of the
escribano. The escribano must make affidavit of the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the escribano gravely took the box, descended the
carpeted stairway leading to the bottom of the excavation and with due
solemnity placed it in the hole in the stone. The curate then took the
hyssop and sprinkled the stones with holy water.</p>
<p class="par">Now the moment had arrived for each one to place his
trowelful of mortar on the face of the large stone lying in the trench,
in order that the other might be fitted and fastened to it. Ibarra
handed the alcalde a mason&rsquo;s trowel, on the wide silver Made of
which was engraved the date. But the alcalde first gave a harangue in
Spanish:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;People of San Diego! We have the honor to preside
over a ceremony whose importance you will not understand unless We tell
you of it. A school is being founded, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e5915" href="#xd24e5915" name="xd24e5915">253</a>]</span>the
school is the basis of society, the school is the book in which is
written the future of the nations! Show us the schools of a people and
We will show you what that people is.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;People of San Diego! Thank God, who has given you
holy priests, and the government of the mother country, which
untiringly spreads civilization through these fertile isles, protected
beneath her glorious mantle! Thank God, who has taken pity on you and
sent you these humble priests who enlighten you and teach you the
divine word! Thank the government, which has made, is making, and will
continue to make, so many sacrifices for you and your children!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And now that the first stone of this important
edifice is consecrated, We, alcalde-mayor of this province, in the name
of his Majesty the King, whom God preserve, King of the Spains, in the
name of the illustrious Spanish government and under the protection of
its spotless and ever-victorious banner, We consecrate this act and
begin the construction of this schoolhouse! People of San Diego, long
live the King! Long live Spain! Long live the friars! Long live the
Catholic Religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Many voices were raised in answer, adding, &ldquo;Long
live the Se&ntilde;or Alcalde!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He then majestically descended to the strains of the
band, which began to play, deposited several trowelfuls of mortar on
the stone, and with equal majesty reascended. The employees
applauded.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra offered another trowel to the curate, who, after
fixing his eyes on him for a moment, descended slowly. Half-way down
the steps he raised his eyes to look at the stone, which hung fastened
by the stout cables, but this was only for a second, and he then went
on down. He did the same as the alcalde, but this time more applause
was heard, for to the employees were added some friars and Capitan
Tiago.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi then seemed to seek for some one to whom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5930" href="#xd24e5930" name=
"xd24e5930">254</a>]</span>he might give the trowel. He looked
doubtfully at Maria Clara, but changing his mind, offered it to the
escribano. The latter in gallantry offered it to Maria Clara, who
smilingly refused it. The friars, the employees, and the alferez went
down one after another, nor was Capitan Tiago forgotten. Ibarra only
was left, and the order was about to be given for the yellowish
individual to lower the stone when the curate remembered the youth and
said to him in a joking tone, with affected familiarity:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to put on your trowelful,
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should be a Juan Palomo, to prepare the meal
and eat it myself,&rdquo; answered the latter in the same tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said the alcalde, shoving him
forward gently. &ldquo;Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll order that the stone be
not lowered at all and we&rsquo;ll be here until doomsday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Before such a terrible threat Ibarra had to obey. He
exchanged the small silver trowel for a large iron one, an act which
caused some of the spectators to smile, and went forward tranquilly.
Elias gazed at him with such an indefinable expression that on seeing
it one might have said that his whole life was concentrated in his
eyes. The yellowish individual stared into the trench, which opened at
his feet. After directing a rapid glance at the heavy stone hanging
over his head and another at Elias and the yellowish individual, Ibarra
said to &Ntilde;or Juan in a somewhat unsteady voice, &ldquo;Give me
the mortar and get me another trowel up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The youth remained alone. Elias no longer looked at him,
for his eyes were fastened on the hand of the yellowish individual,
who, leaning over the trench, was anxiously following the movements of
Ibarra. There was heard the noise of the trowel scraping on the stone
in the midst of a feeble murmur among the employees, who were
congratulating the alcalde on his speech.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly a crash was heard. The pulley tied at the base
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5944" href="#xd24e5944" name=
"xd24e5944">255</a>]</span>of the derrick jumped up and after it the
windlass, which struck the heavy posts like a battering-ram. The
timbers shook, the fastenings flew apart, and the whole apparatus fell
in a second with a frightful crash. A cloud of dust arose, while a cry
of horror from a thousand voices filled the air. Nearly all fled; only
a few dashed toward the trench. Maria Clara and Padre Salvi remained in
their places, pale, motionless, and speechless.</p>
<p class="par">When the dust had cleared away a little, they saw Ibarra
standing among beams, posts, and cables, between the windlass and the
heavy stone, which in its rapid descent had shaken and crushed
everything. The youth still held the trowel in his hand and was staring
with frightened eyes at the body of a man which lay at his feet
half-buried among the timbers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not killed! You&rsquo;re still
alive! For God&rsquo;s sake, speak!&rdquo; cried several employees,
full of terror and solicitude.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A miracle! A miracle!&rdquo; shouted some.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come and extricate the body of this poor
devil!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra like one arousing himself from
sleep.</p>
<p class="par">On hearing his voice Maria Clara felt her strength leave
her and fell half-fainting into the arms of her friends.</p>
<p class="par">Great confusion prevailed. All were talking,
gesticulating, running about, descending into the trench, coming up
again, all amazed and terrified.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who is the dead man? Is he still alive?&rdquo;
asked the alferez.</p>
<p class="par">The corpse was identified as that of the yellowish
individual who had been operating the windlass.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Arrest the foreman on the work!&rdquo; was the
first thing that the alcalde was able to say.</p>
<p class="par">They examined the corpse, placing their hands on the
chest, but the heart had ceased to beat. The blow had struck him on the
head, and blood was flowing from his nose, mouth, and ears. On his neck
were to be noticed some peculiar marks, four deep depressions toward
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e5967" href="#xd24e5967" name=
"xd24e5967">256</a>]</span>back and one more somewhat larger on the
other side, which induced the belief that a hand of steel had caught
him as in a pair of pincers.</p>
<p class="par">The priests felicitated the youth warmly and shook his
hand. The Franciscan of humble aspect who had served as holy ghost for
Padre Damaso exclaimed with tearful eyes, &ldquo;God is just, God is
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When I think that a few moments before I was down
there!&rdquo; said one of the employees to Ibarra. &ldquo;What if I had
happened to be the last!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It makes my hair stand on end!&rdquo; remarked
another partly bald individual.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that it happened to you and not to
me,&rdquo; murmured an old man tremblingly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Pascual!&rdquo; exclaimed some of the
Spaniards.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say that because the young man is not dead. If
I had not been crushed, I should have died afterwards merely from
thinking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But Ibarra was already at a distance informing himself
as to Maria Clara&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let this stop the fiesta,
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo; said the alcalde. &ldquo;Praise God, the
dead man is neither a priest nor a Spaniard! We must rejoice over your
escape! Think if the stone had caught you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There are presentiments, there are
presentiments!&rdquo; exclaimed the escribano. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said
so before! Se&ntilde;or Ibarra didn&rsquo;t go down willingly. I saw
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The dead man is only an Indian!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let the fiesta go on! Music! Sadness will never
resuscitate the dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An investigation shall be made right
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Send for the directorcillo!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Arrest the foreman on the work! To the stocks
with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the stocks! Music! To the stocks with the
foreman!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rdquo; said Ibarra gravely,
&ldquo;if mourning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6002" href=
"#xd24e6002" name="xd24e6002">257</a>]</span>will not resuscitate the
dead, much less will arresting this man about whose guilt we know
nothing. I will be security for his person and so I ask his liberty for
these days at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well! But don&rsquo;t let him do it
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All kinds of rumors began to circulate. The idea of a
miracle was soon an accepted fact, although Fray Salvi seemed to
rejoice but little over a miracle attributed to a saint of his Order
and in his parish. There were not lacking those who added that they had
seen descending into the trench, when everything was tumbling down, a
figure in a dark robe like that of the Franciscans. There was no doubt
about it; it was San Diego himself! It was also noted that Ibarra had
attended mass and that the yellowish individual had not&mdash;it was
all as clear as the sun!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see! You didn&rsquo;t want to go to
mass!&rdquo; said a mother to her son. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t whipped
you to make you go you would now be on your way to the town hall, like
him, in a cart!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The yellowish individual, or rather his corpse, wrapped
up in a mat, was in fact being carried to the town hall. Ibarra hurried
home to change his clothes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A bad beginning, huh!&rdquo; commented old Tasio,
as he moved away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6015" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Free Thought</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ibarra was just putting the finishing touches to a
change of clothing when a servant informed him that a countryman was
asking for him. Supposing it to be one of his laborers, he ordered that
he be brought into his office, or study, which was at the same time a
library and a chemical laboratory. Greatly to his surprise he found
himself face to face with the severe and mysterious figure of
Elias.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You saved my life,&rdquo; said the pilot in
Tagalog, noticing Ibarra&rsquo;s start of surprise. &ldquo;I have
partly paid the debt and you have nothing to thank me for, but quite
the opposite. I&rsquo;ve come to ask a favor of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; answered the youth in the same
language, puzzled by the pilot&rsquo;s gravity.</p>
<p class="par">Elias stared into Ibarra&rsquo;s eyes for some seconds
before he replied, &ldquo;When human courts try to clear up this
mystery, I beg of you not to speak to any one of the warning that I
gave you in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; answered the youth in a
rather disgusted tone. &ldquo;I know that you&rsquo;re wanted, but
I&rsquo;m no informer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not on my account, not on my
account!&rdquo; exclaimed Elias with some vigor and haughtiness.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on your own account. I fear nothing from
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra&rsquo;s surprise increased. The tone in which
this rustics&mdash;formerly a pilot&mdash;spoke was new and did not
seem to harmonize with either his condition or his fortune. &ldquo;What
do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, interrogating that mysterious individual
with his looks.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6036" href=
"#xd24e6036" name="xd24e6036">259</a>]</span>&ldquo;I do not talk in
enigmas but try to express myself clearly; for your greater security,
it is better that your enemies think you unsuspecting and
unprepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra recoiled. &ldquo;My enemies? Have I
enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All of us have them, sir, from the smallest
insect up to man, from the poorest and humblest to the richest and most
powerful! Enmity is the law of life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra gazed at him in silence for a while, then
murmured, &ldquo;You are neither a pilot nor a rustic!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have enemies in high and low places,&rdquo;
continued Elias, without heeding the young man&rsquo;s words.
&ldquo;You are planning a great undertaking, you have a past. Your
father and your grandfather had enemies because they had passions, and
in life it is not the criminal who provokes the most hate but the
honest man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know who my enemies are?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias meditated for a moment. &ldquo;I knew
one&mdash;him who is dead,&rdquo; he finally answered. &ldquo;Last
night I learned that a plot against you was being hatched, from some
words exchanged with an unknown person who lost himself in the crowd.
&lsquo;The fish will not eat him, as they did his father; you&rsquo;ll
see tomorrow,&rsquo; the unknown said. These words caught my attention
not only by their meaning but also on account of the person who uttered
them, for he had some days before presented himself to the foreman on
the work with the express request that he be allowed to superintend the
placing of the stone. He didn&rsquo;t ask for much pay but made a show
of great knowledge. I hadn&rsquo;t sufficient reason for believing in
his bad intentions, but something within told me that my conjectures
were true and therefore I chose as the suitable occasion to warn you a
moment when you could not ask me any questions. The rest you have seen
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For a long time after Elias had become silent Ibarra
remained thoughtful, not answering him or saying a word.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that that man is dead!&rdquo; he exclaimed at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6053" href="#xd24e6053" name=
"xd24e6053">260</a>]</span>length. &ldquo;From him something more might
have been learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If he had lived, he would have escaped from the
trembling hand of blind human justice. God has judged him, God has
killed him, let God be the only Judge!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crisostomo gazed for a moment at the man, who, while he
spoke thus, exposed his muscular arms covered with lumps and bruises.
&ldquo;Do you also believe in the miracle?&rdquo; he asked with a
smile. &ldquo;You know what a miracle the people are talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Were I to believe in miracles, I should not
believe in God. I should believe in a deified man, I should believe
that man had really created a god in his own image and likeness,&rdquo;
the mysterious pilot answered solemnly. &ldquo;But I believe in Him, I
have felt His hand more than once. When the whole apparatus was falling
down and threatening destruction to all who happened to be near it, I,
I myself, caught the criminal, I placed myself at his side. He was
struck and I am safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You! So it was you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes! I caught him when he tried to escape, once
his deadly work had begun. I saw his crime, and I say this to you: let
God be the sole judge among men, let Him be the only one to have the
right over life, let no man ever think to take His place!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you in this instance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; interrupted Elias, guessing the
objection. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the same. When a man condemns others
to death or destroys their future forever he does it with impunity and
uses the strength of others to execute his judgments, which after all
may be mistaken or erroneous. But I, in exposing the criminal to the
same peril that he had prepared for others, incurred the same risk as
he did. I did not kill him, but let the hand of God smite
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe in
accidents?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Believing in accidents is like believing in
miracles; both presuppose that God does not know the future. What
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6074" href="#xd24e6074" name=
"xd24e6074">261</a>]</span>is an accident? An event that no one has at
all foreseen. What is a miracle? A contradiction, an overturning of
natural laws. Lack of foresight and contradiction in the Intelligence
that rules the machinery of the world indicate two great
defects.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Ibarra again asked with some
awe.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you ever studied?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have had to believe greatly in God, because I
have lost faith in men,&rdquo; answered the pilot, avoiding the
question.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra thought he understood this hunted youth; he
rejected human justice, he refused to recognize the right of man to
judge his fellows, he protested against force and the superiority of
some classes over others.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But nevertheless you must admit the necessity of
human justice, however imperfect it may be,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;God, in spite of the many ministers He may have on earth,
cannot, or rather does not, pronounce His judgments clearly to settle
the million conflicts that our passions excite. It is proper, it is
necessary, it is just, that man sometimes judge his fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, to do good, but not to do ill, to correct
and to better, but not to destroy, for if his judgments are wrong he
hasn&rsquo;t the power to remedy the evil he has done. But,&rdquo; he
added with a change of tone, &ldquo;this discussion is beyond my powers
and I&rsquo;m detaining you, who are being waited for. Don&rsquo;t
forget what I&rsquo;ve just told you&mdash;you have enemies. Take care
of yourself for the good of our country.&rdquo; Saying this, he turned
to go.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whenever you wish and always when I can be of
service to you. I am still your debtor.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Dinner</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There in the decorated kiosk the great men of the
province were dining. The alcalde occupied one end of the table and
Ibarra the other. At the young man&rsquo;s right sat Maria Clara and at
his left the escribano. Capitan Tiago, the alferez, the
gobernadorcillo, the friars, the employees, and the few young ladies
who had remained sat, not according to rank, but according to their
inclinations. The meal was quite animated and happy.</p>
<p class="par">When the dinner was half over, a messenger came in
search of Capitan Tiago with a telegram, to open which he naturally
requested the permission of the others, who very naturally begged him
to do so. The worthy capitan at first knitted his eyebrows, then raised
them; his face became pale, then lighted up as he hastily folded the
paper and arose.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he announced in confusion,
&ldquo;his Excellency the Captain-General is coming this evening to
honor my house.&rdquo; Thereupon he set off at a run, hatless, taking
with him the message and his napkin.</p>
<p class="par">He was followed by exclamations and questions, for a cry
of &ldquo;Tulisanes!&rdquo; would not have produced greater effect.
&ldquo;But, listen!&rdquo; &ldquo;When is he coming?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell
us about it!&rdquo; &ldquo;His Excellency!&rdquo; But Capitan Tiago was
already far away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His Excellency is coming and will stay at Capitan
Tiago&rsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed some without taking into consideration
the fact that his daughter and future son-in-law were present.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The choice couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo;
answered the latter.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6113" href=
"#xd24e6113" name="xd24e6113">263</a>]</span>The friars gazed at one
another with looks that seemed to say: &ldquo;The Captain-General is
playing another one of his tricks, he is slighting us, for he ought to
stay at the convento,&rdquo; but since this was the thought of all they
remained silent, none of them giving expression to it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was told of this yesterday,&rdquo; said the
alcalde, &ldquo;but at that time his Excellency had not yet fully
decided.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know, Se&ntilde;or Alcalde, how long the
Captain-General thinks of staying here?&rdquo; asked the alferez
uneasily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With certainty, no. His Excellency likes to give
surprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here come some more messages.&rdquo; These were
for the alcalde, the alferez, and the gobernadorcillo, and contained
the same announcement. The friars noted well that none came directed to
the curate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His Excellency will arrive at four this
afternoon, gentlemen!&rdquo; announced the alcalde solemnly. &ldquo;So
we can finish our meal in peace.&rdquo; Leonidas at Thermopylae could
not have said more cheerfully, &ldquo;Tonight we shall sup with
Pluto!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The conversation again resumed its ordinary course.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I note the absence of our great preacher,&rdquo;
timidly remarked an employee of inoffensive aspect who had not opened
his mouth up to the time of eating, and who spoke now for the first
time in the whole morning.</p>
<p class="par">All who knew the history of Crisostomo&rsquo;s father
made a movement and winked, as if to say, &ldquo;Get out! Fools rush
in&mdash;&rdquo; But some one more charitably disposed answered,
&ldquo;He must be rather tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Rather?&rdquo; exclaimed the alferez. &ldquo;He
must be exhausted, and as they say here, all fagged out. What a sermon
it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A splendid sermon&mdash;wonderful!&rdquo; said
the escribano.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Magnificent&mdash;profound!&rdquo; added the
correspondent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To be able to talk so much, it&rsquo;s necessary
to have the lungs that he has,&rdquo; observed Padre Manuel Martin. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6140" href="#xd24e6140" name=
"xd24e6140">264</a>]</span>Augustinian did not concede him anything
more than lungs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And his fertility of expression!&rdquo; added
Padre Salvi.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know that Se&ntilde;or Ibarra has the best
cook in the province?&rdquo; remarked the alcalde, to cut short such
talk.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You may well say that, but his beautiful neighbor
doesn&rsquo;t wish to honor the table, for she is scarcely eating a
bite,&rdquo; observed one of the employees.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara blushed. &ldquo;I thank the gentleman, he
troubles himself too much on my account,&rdquo; she stammered timidly,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you honor it enough merely by being
present,&rdquo; concluded the gallant alcalde as he turned to Padre
Salvi.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said in a loud voice,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve observed that during the whole day your Reverence has
been silent and thoughtful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alcalde is a great observer,&rdquo; remarked
Fray Sibyla in a meaning tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a habit of mine,&rdquo; stammered the
Franciscan. &ldquo;It pleases me more to listen than to
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Reverence always takes care to win and not
to lose,&rdquo; said the alferez in a jesting tone.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi, however, did not take this as a joke, for
his gaze brightened a moment as he replied, &ldquo;The alferez knows
very well these days that I&rsquo;m not the one who is winning or
losing most.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez turned the hit aside with a forced laugh,
pretending not to take it to himself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, gentlemen, I don&rsquo;t understand how it
is possible to talk of winnings and losses,&rdquo; interposed the
alcalde. &ldquo;What will these amiable and discreet young ladies who
honor us with their company think of us? For me the young women are
like the &AElig;olian harps in the middle of the night&mdash;it is
necessary to listen with close attention in order that their ineffable
harmonies may elevate the soul to the celestial spheres of the infinite
and the ideal!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6169" href=
"#xd24e6169" name="xd24e6169">265</a>]</span>&ldquo;Your Honor is
becoming poetical!&rdquo; exclaimed the escribano gleefully, and both
emptied their wine-glasses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said the alcalde as
he wiped his lips. &ldquo;Opportunity, while it doesn&rsquo;t always
make the thief, makes the poet. In my youth I composed verses which
were really not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So your Excellency has been unfaithful to the
Muses to follow Themis,&rdquo; emphatically declared our mythical or
mythological correspondent.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pshaw, what would you have? To run through the
entire social scale was always my dream. Yesterday I was gathering
flowers and singing songs, today I wield the rod of justice and serve
Humanity, tomorrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tomorrow your Honor will throw the rod into the
fire to warm yourself by it in the winter of life, and take an
appointment in the cabinet,&rdquo; added Padre Sibyla.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pshaw! Yes&mdash;no&mdash;to be a cabinet
official isn&rsquo;t exactly my beau-ideal: any upstart may become one.
A villa in the North in which to spend the summer, a mansion in Madrid,
and some property in Andalusia for the winter&mdash;there we shall live
remembering our beloved Philippines. Of me Voltaire would not say,
&lsquo;We have lived among these people only to enrich ourselves and to
calumniate them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alcalde quoted this in French, so the employees,
thinking that his Honor had cracked a joke, began to laugh in
appreciation of it. Some of the friars did likewise, since they did not
know that the Voltaire mentioned was the same Voltaire whom they had so
often cursed and consigned to hell. But Padre Sibyla was aware of it
and became serious from the belief that the alcalde had said something
heretical or impious.</p>
<p class="par">In the other kiosk the children were eating under the
direction of their teacher. For Filipino children they were rather
noisy, since at the table and in the presence of other persons their
sins are generally more of omission than of commission. Perhaps one who
was using the tableware improperly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e6185" href="#xd24e6185" name="xd24e6185">266</a>]</span>would be
corrected by his neighbor and from this there would arise a noisy
discussion in which each would have his partisans. Some would say the
spoon, others the knife or the fork, and as no one was considered an
authority there would arise the contention that God is Christ or, more
clearly, a dispute of theologians. Their fathers and mothers winked,
made signs, nudged one another, and showed their happiness by their
smiles.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ya!&rdquo; exclaimed a countrywoman to an old man
who was mashing buyo in his <i>kalikut</i>, &ldquo;in spite of the fact
that my husband is opposed to it, my Andoy shall be a priest.
It&rsquo;s true that we&rsquo;re poor, but we&rsquo;ll work, and if
necessary we&rsquo;ll beg alms. There are not lacking those who will
give money so that the poor may take holy orders. Does not Brother
Mateo, a man who does not lie, say that Pope Sextus was a herder of
carabaos in Batangas? Well then, look at my Andoy, see if he
hasn&rsquo;t already the face of a <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Vincent!&rdquo; The good mother watered at the
mouth to see her son take hold of a fork with both hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; added the old man, rolling
his quid of buyo. &ldquo;If Andoy gets to be Pope we&rsquo;ll go to
Rome he, he! I can still walk well, and if I die&mdash;he,
he!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, granddad! Andoy won&rsquo;t
forget that you taught him how to weave baskets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Petra. I also believe that
your son will be great, at least a patriarch. I have never seen any one
who learned the business in a shorter time. Yes, he&rsquo;ll remember
me when as Pope or bishop he entertains himself in making baskets for
his cook. He&rsquo;ll then say masses for my soul&mdash;he, he!&rdquo;
With this hope the good old man again filled his <i>kalikut</i> with
buyo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If God hears my prayers and my hopes are
fulfilled, I&rsquo;ll say to Andoy, &lsquo;Son, take away all our sins
and send us to Heaven!&rsquo; Then we shan&rsquo;t need to pray and
fast and buy indulgences. One whose son is a blessed Pope can commit
sins!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Send him to my house tomorrow, Petra,&rdquo;
cried the old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6209" href=
"#xd24e6209" name="xd24e6209">267</a>]</span>man enthusiastically,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll teach him to weave the <i>nito!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Huh! Get out! What are you dreaming about,
grand-dad? Do you still think that the Popes even move their hands? The
curate, being nothing more than a curate, only works in the
mass&mdash;when he turns around! The Archbishop doesn&rsquo;t even turn
around, for he says mass sitting down. So the Pope&mdash;the Pope says
it in bed with a fan! What are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of nothing more, Petra, than that he know how to
weave the <i>nito</i>. It would be well for him to be able to sell hats
and cigar-cases so that he wouldn&rsquo;t have to beg alms, as the
curate does here every year in the name of the Pope. It always fills me
with compassion to see a saint poor, so I give all my
savings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Another countryman here joined in the conversation,
saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all settled, cumare,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6223src" href="#xd24e6223" name="xd24e6223src">1</a> my son has
got to be a doctor, there&rsquo;s nothing like being a
doctor!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Doctor! What are you talking about,
cumpare?&rdquo; retorted Petra. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like being
a curate!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A curate, pish! A curate? The doctor makes lots
of money, the sick people worship him, cumare!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Excuse me! The curate, by making three or four
turns and saying <i>deminos pabiscum</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6246src" href="#xd24e6246" name="xd24e6246src">2</a> eats God and
makes money. All, even the women, tell him their secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the doctor? What do you think a doctor is?
The doctor sees all that the women have, he feels the pulses of the
<i>dalagas!</i> I&rsquo;d just like to be a doctor for a
week!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the curate, perhaps the curate doesn&rsquo;t
see what your doctor sees? Better still, you know the saying,
&lsquo;the fattest chicken and the roundest leg for the
curate!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6258" href=
"#xd24e6258" name="xd24e6258">268</a>]</span>&ldquo;What of that? Do
the doctors eat dried fish? Do they soil their fingers eating
salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does the curate dirty his hands as your doctors
do? He has great estates and when he works he works with music and has
sacristans to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the confessing, cumare? Isn&rsquo;t that
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No work about that! I&rsquo;d just like to be
confessing everybody! While we work and sweat to find out what our own
neighbors are doing, the curate does nothing more than take a seat and
they tell him everything. Sometimes he falls asleep, but he lets out
two or three blessings and we are again the children of God! I&rsquo;d
just like to be a curate for one evening in Lent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the preaching? You can&rsquo;t tell me that
it&rsquo;s not work. Just look how the fat curate was sweating this
morning,&rdquo; objected the rustic, who felt himself being beaten into
retreat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Preaching! Work to preach! Where&rsquo;s your
judgment? I&rsquo;d just like to be talking half a day from the pulpit,
scolding and quarreling with everybody, without any one daring to
reply, and be getting paid for it besides. I&rsquo;d just like to be
the curate for one morning when those who are in debt to me are
attending mass! Look there now, how Padre Damaso gets fat with so much
scolding and beating.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Padre Damaso was, indeed, approaching with the gait of a
heavy man. He was half smiling, but in such a malignant way that
Ibarra, upon seeing him, lost the thread of his talk. The padre was
greeted with some surprise but with signs of pleasure on the part of
all except Ibarra. They were then at the dessert and the champagne was
foaming in the glasses.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Damaso&rsquo;s smile became nervous when he saw
Maria Clara seated at Crisostomo&rsquo;s right. He took a seat beside
the alcalde and said in the midst of a significant silence, &ldquo;Were
you discussing something, gentlemen? Go ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6275" href=
"#xd24e6275" name="xd24e6275">269</a>]</span>&ldquo;We were at the
toasts,&rdquo; answered the alcalde. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra was
mentioning all who have helped him in his philanthropic enterprise and
was speaking of the architect when your Reverence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything about
architecture,&rdquo; interrupted Padre Damaso, &ldquo;but I laugh at
architects and the fools who employ them. Here you have it&mdash;I drew
the plan of this church and it&rsquo;s perfectly constructed, so an
English jeweler who stopped in the convento one day assured me. To draw
a plan one needs only to have two fingers&rsquo; breadth of
forehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; answered the alcalde, seeing
that Ibarra was silent, &ldquo;when we consider certain buildings, as,
for example, this schoolhouse, we need an expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Get out with your experts!&rdquo; exclaimed the
priest with a sneer. &ldquo;Only a fool needs experts! One must be more
of a brute than the Indians, who build their own houses, not to know
how to construct four walls and put a roof on top of them. That&rsquo;s
all a schoolhouse is!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The guests gazed at Ibarra, who had turned pale, but he
continued as if in conversation with Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But your Reverence should
consider&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;See now,&rdquo; went on the Franciscan, not
allowing the alcalde to continue, &ldquo;look how one of our lay
brothers, the most stupid that we have, has constructed a hospital,
good, pretty, and cheap. He made them work hard and paid only eight
cuartos a day even to those who had to come from other towns. He knew
how to handle them, not like a lot of cranks and little mestizos who
are spoiling them by paying three or four reals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does your Reverence say that he paid only eight
cuartos? Impossible!&rdquo; The alcalde was trying to change the course
of the conversation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir, and those who pride themselves on being
good Spaniards ought to imitate him. You see now, since the Suez Canal
was opened, the corruption that has come in here. Formerly, when we had
to double the Cape, neither <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6294"
href="#xd24e6294" name="xd24e6294">270</a>]</span>so many vagabonds
came here nor so many others went from here to become
vagabonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Padre Damaso&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know well enough what the Indian
is&mdash;just as soon as he gets a little learning he sets himself up
as a doctor! All these little fellows that go to
Europe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, listen, your Reverence!&rdquo; interrupted
the alcalde, who was becoming nervous over the aggressiveness of such
talk.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Every one ends up as he deserves,&rdquo; the
friar continued. &ldquo;The hand of God is manifest in the midst of it
all, and one must be blind not to see it. Even in this life the fathers
of such vipers receive their punishment, they die in jail ha, ha! As we
might say, they have nowhere&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But he did not finish the sentence. Ibarra, livid, had
been following him with his gaze and upon hearing this allusion to his
father jumped up and dropped a heavy hand on the priest&rsquo;s head,
so that he fell back stunned. The company was so filled with surprise
and fright that no one made any movement to interfere.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo; cried the youth in a terrible
voice, as he caught up a sharp knife and placed his foot on the neck of
the friar, who was recovering from the shock of his fall. &ldquo;Let
him who values his life keep away!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The youth was beside himself. His whole body trembled
and his eyes rolled threateningly in their sockets. Fray Damaso arose
with an effort, but the youth caught him by the neck and shook him
until he again fell doubled over on his knees.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra! Se&ntilde;or Ibarra!&rdquo;
stammered some. But no one, not even the alferez himself, dared to
approach the gleaming knife, when they considered the youth&rsquo;s
strength and the condition of his mind. All seemed to be paralyzed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You, here! You have been silent, now it is my
turn! I have tried to avoid this, but God brings me to it&mdash;let God
be the judge!&rdquo; The youth was breathing laboriously, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6315" href="#xd24e6315" name=
"xd24e6315">271</a>]</span>but with a hand of iron he held down the
Franciscan, who was struggling vainly to free himself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My heart beats tranquilly, my hand is
sure,&rdquo; he began, looking around him. &ldquo;First, is there one
among you, one who has not loved his father, who was born in such shame
and humiliation that he hates his memory? You see? You understand this
silence? Priest of a God of peace, with your mouth full of sanctity and
religion and your heart full of evil, you cannot know what a father is,
or you might have thought of your own! In all this crowd which you
despise there is not one like you! You are condemned!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The persons surrounding him, thinking that he was about
to commit murder, made a movement.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Away!&rdquo; he cried again in a threatening
voice. &ldquo;What, do you fear that I shall stain my hands with impure
blood? Have I not told you that my heart beats tranquilly? Away from
us! Listen, priests and judges, you who think yourselves other men and
attribute to yourselves other rights: my father was an honorable
man,&mdash;ask these people here, who venerate his memory. My father
was a good citizen and he sacrificed himself for me and for the good of
his country. His house was open and his table was set for the stranger
and the outcast who came to him in distress! He was a Christian who
always did good and who never oppressed the unprotected or afflicted
those in trouble. To this man here he opened his doors, he made him sit
at his table and called him his friend. And how has this man repaid
him? He calumniated him, persecuted him, raised up against him all the
ignorant by availing himself of the sanctity of his position; he
outraged his tomb, dishonored his memory, and persecuted him even in
the sleep of death! Not satisfied with this, he persecutes the son now!
I have fled from him, I have avoided his presence. You this morning
heard him profane the pulpit, pointing me out to popular fanaticism,
and I held my peace! Now he comes here to seek a quarrel with me. To
your surprise, I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6323" href=
"#xd24e6323" name="xd24e6323">272</a>]</span>suffered in silence, but
he again insults the most sacred memory that there is for a son. You
who are here, priests and judges, have you seen your aged father wear
himself out working for you, separating himself from you for your
welfare, have you seen him die of sorrow in a prison sighing for your
embrace, seeking some one to comfort him, alone, sick, when you were in
a foreign land? Have you afterwards heard his name dishonored, have you
found his tomb empty when you went to pray beside it? No? You are
silent, you condemn him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He raised his hand, but with the swiftness of light a
girlish form put itself between them and delicate fingers restrained
the avenging arm. It was Maria Clara. Ibarra stared at her with a look
that seemed to reflect madness. Slowly his clenched fingers relaxed,
letting fall the body of the Franciscan and the knife. Covering his
face, he fled through the crowd. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">News of the incident soon spread throughout the
town. At first all were incredulous, but, having to yield to the fact,
they broke out into exclamations of surprise. Each one, according to
his moral lights, made his comments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre Damaso is dead,&rdquo; said some.
&ldquo;When they picked him up his face was covered with blood and he
wasn&rsquo;t breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May he rest in peace! But he hasn&rsquo;t any
more than settled his debts!&rdquo; exclaimed a young man. &ldquo;Look
what he did this morning in the convento&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t any
name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did he do? Did he beat up the coadjutor
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did he do? Tell us about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You saw that Spanish mestizo go out through the
sacristy in the midst of the sermon?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, we saw him. Padre Damaso took note of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, after the sermon he sent for the young man
and asked him why he had gone out. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
Tagalog, Padre,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;And why did you joke about
it, saying that it was Greek?&rsquo; yelled Padre Damaso, slapping the
young man in the face. The latter retorted and the two came to blows
until they were separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If that had happened to me&mdash;&rdquo; hissed a
student between his teeth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of the action of the
Franciscan,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;since Religion ought not to be
imposed on any one as a punishment or a penance. But I am almost glad
of it, for I know that young man, I know that he&rsquo;s from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6354" href="#xd24e6354" name=
"xd24e6354">274</a>]</span>San Pedro Makati and that he talks Tagalog
well. Now he wants to be taken for a recent arrival from Russia and
prides himself on appearing not to know the language of his
fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then God makes them and they rush
together!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6358src" href="#xd24e6358"
name="xd24e6358src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Still we must protest against such
actions,&rdquo; exclaimed another student. &ldquo;To remain silent
would be to assent to the abuse, and what has happened may be repeated
with any one of us. We&rsquo;re going back to the times of
Nero!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; replied another.
&ldquo;Nero was a great artist, while Padre Damaso is only a tiresome
preacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The comments of the older persons were of a different
kind. While they were waiting for the arrival of the Captain-General in
a hut outside the town, the gobernadorcillo was saying, &ldquo;To tell
who was right and who was wrong, is not an easy matter. Yet if
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra had used more prudence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If Padre Damaso had used half the prudence of
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, you mean to say, perhaps!&rdquo; interrupted Don
Filipo. &ldquo;The bad thing about it is that they exchanged
parts&mdash;the youth conducted himself like an old man and the old man
like a youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you say that no one moved, no one went near
to separate them, except Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; asked
Capitan Martin. &ldquo;None of the friars, nor the alcalde? Ahem! Worse
and worse! I shouldn&rsquo;t like to be in that young man&rsquo;s skin.
No one will forgive him for having been afraid of him. Worse and worse,
ahem!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Capitan Basilio
curiously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Don Filipo, exchanging a look
with the latter, &ldquo;that the people won&rsquo;t desert him. We must
keep in mind what his family has done and what he is trying to do now.
And if, as may happen, the people, being intimidated, are silent, his
friends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, gentlemen,&rdquo; interrupted the
gobernadorcillo, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6377" href=
"#xd24e6377" name="xd24e6377">275</a>]</span>&ldquo;what can we do?
What can the people do? Happen what will, the friars are always
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They are <i>always</i> right because we
<i>always</i> allow them to be,&rdquo; answered Don Filipo impatiently,
putting double stress on the italicized word. &ldquo;Let us be right
once and then we&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The gobernadorcillo scratched his head and stared at the
roof while he replied in a sour tone, &ldquo;Ay! the heat of the blood!
You don&rsquo;t seem to realize yet what country we&rsquo;re in, you
don&rsquo;t know your countrymen. The friars are rich and united, while
we are divided and poor. Yes, try to defend yourself and you&rsquo;ll
see how the people will leave you in the lurch.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Filipo bitterly.
&ldquo;That will happen as long as you think that way, as long as fear
and prudence are synonyms. More attention is paid to a possible evil
than to a necessary good. At once fear, and not confidence, presents
itself; each one thinks only of himself, no one thinks of the rest, and
therefore we are all weak!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well then, think of others before yourself and
you&rsquo;ll see how they&rsquo;ll leave you in the lurch. Don&rsquo;t
you know the proverb, &lsquo;Charity begins at home&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You had better say,&rdquo; replied the
exasperated teniente-mayor, &ldquo;that cowardice begins in selfishness
and ends in shame! This very day I&rsquo;m going to hand in my
resignation to the alcalde. I&rsquo;m tired of passing for a joke
without being useful to anybody. Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The women had opinions of still another kind.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ay<i>!</i>&rdquo; sighed one woman of kindly
expression. &ldquo;The young men are always so! If his good mother were
alive, what would she say? When I think that the like may happen to my
son, who has a violent temper, I almost envy his dead mother. I should
die of grief!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied another.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t cause me any shame if such a thing should
happen to my two sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6406" href=
"#xd24e6406" name="xd24e6406">276</a>]</span> &ldquo;What are you
saying, Capitana Maria!&rdquo; exclaimed the first, clasping her
hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It pleases me to see a son defend the memory of
his parents, Capitana Tinay. What would you say if some day when you
were a widow you heard your husband spoken ill of and your son Antonio
should hang his head and remain silent?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I would deny him my blessing!&rdquo; exclaimed a
third, Sister Rufa, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Deny him my blessing, never!&rdquo; interrupted
the kind Capitana Tinay. &ldquo;A mother ought not to say that! But I
don&rsquo;t know what I should do&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I
believe I&rsquo;d die&mdash;but I shouldn&rsquo;t want to see him
again. But what do you think about it, Capitana Maria?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; added Sister Rufa, &ldquo;it
must not be forgotten that it&rsquo;s a great sin to place your hand on
a sacred person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A father&rsquo;s memory is more sacred!&rdquo;
replied Capitana Maria. &ldquo;No one, not even the Pope himself, much
less Padre Damaso, may profane such a holy memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; murmured Capitana
Tinay, admiring the wisdom of both. &ldquo;Where did you get such good
ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the excommunication and the
condemnation?&rdquo; exclaimed Sister Rufa. &ldquo;What are honor and a
good name in this life if in the other we are damned? Everything passes
away quickly&mdash;but the excommunication&mdash;to outrage a minister
of Christ! No one less than the Pope can pardon that!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God, who commands honor for father and mother,
will pardon it, God will not excommunicate him! And I tell you that if
that young man comes to my house I will receive him and talk with him,
and if I had a daughter I would want him for a son-in-law; he who is a
good son will be a good husband and a good father&mdash;believe it,
Sister Rufa!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think so. Say what you like,
and even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6427" href="#xd24e6427"
name="xd24e6427">277</a>]</span>though you may appear to be right,
I&rsquo;ll always rather believe the curate. Before everything else,
I&rsquo;ll save my soul. What do you say, Capitana Tinny?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, what do you want me to say? You&rsquo;re both
right the curate is right, but God must also be right. I don&rsquo;t
know, I&rsquo;m only a foolish woman. What I&rsquo;m going to do is to
tell my son not to study any more, for they say that persons who know
anything die on the gallows. <i>Mar&iacute;a Sant&iacute;sima</i>, my
son wants to go to Europe!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you thinking of doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell him to stay with me&mdash;why should he know
more? Tomorrow or the next day we shall die, the learned and the
ignorant alike must die, and the only question is to live in
peace.&rdquo; The good old woman sighed and raised her eyes toward the
sky.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Capitana Maria gravely,
&ldquo;if I were rich like you I would let my sons travel; they are
young and will some day be men. I have only a little while to live, we
should see one another in the other life, so sons should aspire to be
more than their fathers, but at our sides we only teach them to be
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ay, what rare thoughts you have!&rdquo; exclaimed
the astonished Capitana Tinay, clasping her hands. &ldquo;It must be
that you didn&rsquo;t suffer in bearing your twin boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For the very reason that I did bear them with
suffering, that I have nurtured and reared them in spite of our
poverty, I do not wish that, after the trouble they&rsquo;re cost me,
they be only half-men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me that you don&rsquo;t love your
children as God commands,&rdquo; said Sister Rufa in a rather severe
tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me, every mother loves her sons in her own
way. One mother loves them for her own sake and another loves them for
their sake. I am one of the latter, for my husband has so taught
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All your ideas, Capitana Maria,&rdquo; said
Sister Rufa, as if preaching, &ldquo;are but little religious. Become a
sister of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6451" href="#xd24e6451"
name="xd24e6451">278</a>]</span>the Holy Rosary or of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis or of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Rita or of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sister Rufa, when I am a worthy sister of men
then I&rsquo;ll try to be a sister of the saints,&rdquo; she answered
with a smile.</p>
<p class="par">To put an end to this chapter of comments and that the
reader may learn in passing what the simple country folk thought of the
incident, we will now go to the plaza, where under the large awning
some rustics are conversing, one of them&mdash;he who dreamed about
doctors of medicine&mdash;being an acquaintance of ours.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What I regret most,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is
that the schoolhouse won&rsquo;t be finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the bystanders
with interest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My son won&rsquo;t be a doctor but a carter,
nothing more! Now there won&rsquo;t be any school!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who says there won&rsquo;t be any school?&rdquo;
asked a rough and robust countryman with wide cheeks and a narrow
head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do! The white padres have called Don Crisostomo
<i>plibastiero</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6479src" href=
"#xd24e6479" name="xd24e6479src">2</a> Now there won&rsquo;t be any
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All stood looking questioningly at each other; that was
a new term to them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And is that a bad name?&rdquo; the rough
countryman made bold to ask.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The worst thing that one Christian can say to
another!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Worse than <i>tarantado</i> and
<i>sarayate?&rdquo;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6496src" href=
"#xd24e6496" name="xd24e6496src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it were only that! I&rsquo;ve been called
those names several times and they didn&rsquo;t even give me a
bellyache.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be worse than
&lsquo;<i>indio,</i>&rsquo; as the alferez says.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The man who was to have a carter for a son became
gloomier, while the other scratched his head in thought.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6517" href=
"#xd24e6517" name="xd24e6517">279</a>]</span>&ldquo;Then it must be
like the <i>betelapora</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6521src" href=
"#xd24e6521" name="xd24e6521src">4</a> that the alferez&rsquo;s old
woman says. Worse than that is to spit on the Host.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s worse than to spit on the Host
on Good Friday,&rdquo; was the grave reply. &ldquo;You remember the
word <i>ispichoso</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6533src" href=
"#xd24e6533" name="xd24e6533src">5</a> which when applied to a man is
enough to have the civil-guards take him into exile or put him in jail
well, <i>plibustiero</i> is much worse. According to what the
telegrapher and the directorcillo said, <i>plibustiero</i>, said by a
Christian, a curate, or a Spaniard to another Christian like us is a
<i>santusdeus with requimiternam</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e6548src" href="#xd24e6548" name="xd24e6548src">6</a> for if they
ever call you a <i>plibustiero</i> then you&rsquo;d better get yourself
shriven and pay your debts, since nothing remains for you but to be
hanged. You know whether the telegrapher and the directorcillo ought to
be informed; one talks with wires and the other knows Spanish and works
only with a pen.&rdquo; All were appalled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May they force me to wear shoes and in all my
life to drink nothing but that vile stuff they call beer, if I ever let
myself be called <i>pelbistero!</i>&rdquo; swore the countryman,
clenching his fists. &ldquo;What, rich as Don Crisostomo is, knowing
Spanish as he does, and able to eat fast with a knife and spoon,
I&rsquo;d laugh at five curates!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The next civil-guard I catch stealing my chickens
I&rsquo;m going to call <i>palabistiero</i>, then I&rsquo;ll go to
confession at once,&rdquo; murmured one of the rustics in a low voice
as he withdrew from the group. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6570"

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">The First Cloud</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house reigned no less
disorder than in the people&rsquo;s imagination. Maria Clara did
nothing but weep and would not listen to the consoling words of her
aunt and of Andeng, her foster-sister. Her father had forbidden her to
speak to Ibarra until the priests should absolve him from the
excommunication. Capitan Tiago himself, in the midst of his
preparations for receiving the Captain-General properly, had been
summoned to the convento.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, daughter,&rdquo; said Aunt
Isabel, as she polished the bright plates of the mirrors with a piece
of chamois. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll withdraw the excommunication,
they&rsquo;ll write now to the Pope, and we&rsquo;ll make a big
poor-offering. Padre Damaso only fainted, he&rsquo;s not
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; whispered Andeng.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage it so that you may talk with him. What are
confessionals for if not that we may sin? Everything is forgiven by
telling it to the curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At length Capitan Tiago returned. They sought in his
face the answer to many questions, and it announced discouragement. The
poor fellow was perspiring; he rubbed his hand across his forehead, but
was unable to say a single word.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What has happened, Santiago?&rdquo; asked Aunt
Isabel anxiously.</p>
<p class="par">He answered by sighing and wiping away a tear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, speak! What has
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just what I feared,&rdquo; he broke out at last,
half in tears. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6592" href=
"#xd24e6592" name="xd24e6592">281</a>]</span>&ldquo;All is lost! Padre
Damaso has ordered me to break the engagement, otherwise he will damn
me in this life and in the next. All of them told me the same, even
Padre Sibyla. I must close the doors of my house against him, and I owe
him over fifty thousand pesos! I told the padres this, but they refused
to take any notice of it. &lsquo;Which do you prefer to lose,&rsquo;
they asked me, &lsquo;fifty thousand pesos or your life and your
soul?&rsquo; Ay, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Anthony, if I had
only known, if I had only known! Don&rsquo;t cry, daughter,&rdquo; he
went on, turning to the sobbing girl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not like your
mother, who never cried except just before you were born. Padre Damaso
told me that a relative of his has just arrived from Spain and you are
to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara covered her ears, while Aunt Isabel
screamed, &ldquo;Santiago, are you crazy? To talk to her of another
sweetheart now! Do you think that your daughter changes sweethearts as
she does her camisa?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way I felt, Isabel. Don
Crisostomo is rich, while the Spaniards marry only for love of money.
But what do you want me to do? They&rsquo;ve threatened me with another
excommunication. They say that not only my soul but also my body is in
great danger&mdash;my body, do you hear, my body!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re only making your daughter more
disconsolate! Isn&rsquo;t the Archbishop your friend? Why don&rsquo;t
you write to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Archbishop is also a friar, the Archbishop
does only what the friars tell him to do. But, Maria, don&rsquo;t cry.
The Captain-General is coming, he&rsquo;ll want to see you, and your
eyes are all red. Ay, I was thinking to spend a happy evening! Without
this misfortune I should be the happiest of men&mdash;every one would
envy me! Be calm, my child, I&rsquo;m more unfortunate than you and
I&rsquo;m not crying. You can have another and better husband, while
I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve lost fifty thousand pesos! Ay, Virgin of Antipolo,
if tonight I may only have luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Salvos, the sound of carriage wheels, the galloping of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6608" href="#xd24e6608" name=
"xd24e6608">282</a>]</span>horses, and a band playing the royal march,
announced the arrival of his Excellency, the Captain-General of the
Philippines. Maria Clara ran to hide herself in her chamber. Poor
child, rough hands that knew not its delicate chords were playing with
her heart! While the house became filled with people and heavy steps,
commanding voices, and the clank of sabers and spurs resounded on all
sides, the afflicted maiden reclined half-kneeling before a picture of
the Virgin represented in that sorrowful loneliness perceived only by
Delaroche, as if he had surprised her returning from the sepulcher of
her Son. But Maria Clara was not thinking of that mother&rsquo;s
sorrow, she was thinking of her own. With her head hanging down over
her breast and her hands resting on the floor she made the picture of a
lily bent by the storm. A future dreamed of and cherished for years,
whose illusions, born in infancy and grown strong throughout youth, had
given form to the very fibers of her being, to be wiped away now from
her mind and heart by a single word! It was enough to stop the beating
of one and to deprive the other of reason.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara was a loving daughter as well as a good and
pious Christian, so it was not the excommunication alone that terrified
her, but the command and the ominous calmness of her father demanding
the sacrifice of her love. Now she felt the whole force of that
affection which until this moment she had hardly suspected. It had been
like a river gliding along peacefully with its banks carpeted by
fragrant flowers and its bed covered with fine sand, so that the wind
hardly ruffled its current as it moved along, seeming hardly to flow at
all; but suddenly its bed becomes narrower, sharp stones block the way,
hoary logs fall across it forming a barrier&mdash;then the stream rises
and roars with its waves boiling and scattering clouds of foam, it
beats against the rocks and rushes into the abyss!</p>
<p class="par">She wanted to pray, but who in despair can pray? Prayers
are for the hours of hope, and when in the absence of this we turn to
God it is only with complaints. &ldquo;My <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e6614" href="#xd24e6614" name=
"xd24e6614">283</a>]</span>God,&rdquo; cried her heart, &ldquo;why dost
Thou thus cut a man off, why dost Thou deny him the love of others?
Thou dost not deny him thy sunlight and thy air nor hide from him the
sight of thy heaven! Why then deny him love, for without a sight of the
sky, without air or sunlight, one can live, but without
love&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Would these cries unheard by men reach the throne of God
or be heard by the Mother of the distressed? The poor maiden who had
never known a mother dared to confide these sorrows of an earthly love
to that pure heart that knew only the love of daughter and of mother.
In her despair she turned to that deified image of womanhood, the most
beautiful idealization of the most ideal of all creatures, to that
poetical creation of Christianity who unites in herself the two most
beautiful phases of womanhood without its sorrows: those of virgin and
mother,&mdash;to her whom we call Mary!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother, mother!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p class="par">Aunt Isabel came to tear her away from her sorrow since
she was being asked for by some friends and by the Captain-General, who
wished to talk with her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aunt, tell them that I&rsquo;m ill,&rdquo; begged
the frightened girl. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to make me play on the
piano and sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your father has promised. Are you going to put
your father in a bad light?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara rose, looked at her aunt, and threw back her
shapely arms, murmuring, &ldquo;Oh, if I only had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But without concluding the phrase she began to make
herself ready for presentation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXXVII</h2>
<h2 class="main">His Excellency</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;I Want to talk with that young man,&rdquo;
said his Excellency to an aide. &ldquo;He has aroused all my
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They have already gone to look for him, General.
But here is a young man from Manila who insists on being introduced. We
told him that your Excellency had no time for interviews, that you had
not come to give audiences, but to see the town and the procession, and
he answered that your Excellency always has time to dispense
justice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His Excellency turned to the alcalde in wonder.
&ldquo;If I am not mistaken,&rdquo; said the latter with a slight bow,
&ldquo;he is the young man who this morning had a quarrel with Padre
Damaso over the sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Still another? Has this friar set himself to stir
up the whole province or does he think that he governs here? Show the
young man in.&rdquo; His Excellency paced nervously from one end of the
sala to the other.</p>
<p class="par">In the hall were gathered various Spaniards mingled with
soldiers and officials of San Diego and neighboring towns, standing in
groups conversing or disputing. There were also to be seen all the
friars, with the exception of Padre Damaso, and they wanted to go in to
pay their respects to his Excellency.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His Excellency the Captain-General begs your
Reverences to wait a moment,&rdquo; said the aide. &ldquo;Come in,
young man!&rdquo; The Manilan who had confounded Greek with Tagalog
entered the room pale and trembling.</p>
<p class="par">All were filled with surprise; surely his Excellency
must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6651" href="#xd24e6651" name=
"xd24e6651">285</a>]</span>be greatly irritated to dare to make the
friars wait! Padre Sibyla remarked, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to
say to him, I&rsquo;m wasting my time here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say the same,&rdquo; added an Augustinian.
&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better that we find out how
he stands?&rdquo; asked Padre Salvi. &ldquo;We should avoid a scandal,
and should be able to remind him of his duties
toward&mdash;religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Reverences may enter, if you so
desire,&rdquo; said the aide as he ushered out the youth who did not
understand Greek and whose countenance was now beaming with
satisfaction.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Sibyla entered first, Padre Salvi, Padre Martin,
and the other priests following. They all made respectful bows with the
exception of Padre Sibyla, who even in bending preserved a certain air
of superiority. Padre Salvi on the other hand almost doubled himself
over the girdle.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Which of your Reverences is Padre Damaso?&rdquo;
asked the Captain-General without any preliminary greeting, neither
asking them to be seated nor inquiring about their health nor
addressing them with the flattering speeches to which such important
personages are accustomed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre Damaso is not here among us, sir,&rdquo;
replied Fray Sibyla in the same dry tone as that used by his
Excellency.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Excellency&rsquo;s servant is in bed
sick,&rdquo; added Padre Salvi humbly. &ldquo;After having the pleasure
of welcoming you and of informing ourselves concerning your
Excellency&rsquo;s health, as is the duty of all good subjects of the
King and of every person of culture, we have come in the name of the
respected servant of your Excellency who has had the
misfortune&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted the Captain-General,
twirling a chair about on one leg and smiling nervously, &ldquo;if all
the servants of my Excellency were like his Reverence, Padre Damaso, I
should prefer myself to serve my Excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6671" href=
"#xd24e6671" name="xd24e6671">286</a>]</span>The reverend gentlemen,
who were standing up physically, did so mentally at this
interruption.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t your Reverences be seated?&rdquo; he
added after a brief pause, moderating his tone a little.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago here appeared in full dress, walking on
tiptoe and leading by the hand Maria Clara, who entered timidly and
with hesitation. Still she bowed gracefully and ceremoniously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is this young lady your daughter?&rdquo; asked
the Captain-General in surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And your Excellency&rsquo;s, General,&rdquo;
answered Capitan Tiago seriously.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6681src"
href="#xd24e6681" name="xd24e6681src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The alcalde and the aides opened their eyes wide, but
his Excellency lost none of his gravity as he took the girl&rsquo;s
hand and said affably, &ldquo;Happy are the fathers who have daughters
like you, se&ntilde;orita! I have heard you spoken of with respect and
admiration and have wanted to see you and thank you for your beautiful
action of this afternoon. I am informed of <i>everything</i> and when I
make my report to his Majesty&rsquo;s government I shall not forget
your noble conduct. Meanwhile, permit me to thank you in the name of
his Majesty, the King, whom I represent here and who loves <i>peace and
tranquillity</i> in his loyal subjects, and for myself, a father who
has daughters of your age, and to propose a reward for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir&mdash;&rdquo; answered the trembling Maria
Clara.</p>
<p class="par">His Excellency guessed what she wanted to say, and so
continued: &ldquo;It is well, se&ntilde;orita, that you are at peace
with your conscience and content with the good opinion of your
fellow-countrymen, with the faith which is its own best reward and
beyond which we should not aspire. But you must not deprive me of an
opportunity to show that if Justice knows how to punish she also knows
how to reward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6697" href=
"#xd24e6697" name="xd24e6697">287</a>]</span>and that she is not always
<i>blind!</i>&rdquo; The italicized words were all spoken in a loud and
significant tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Don Juan Crisostomo Ibarra awaits
the orders of your Excellency!&rdquo; announced the aide in a loud
voice.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara shuddered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain-General.
&ldquo;Allow me, se&ntilde;orita, to express my desire to see you again
before leaving the town, as I still have some very important things to
say to you. Se&ntilde;or Alcalde, you will accompany me during the walk
which I wish to take after the conference that I will hold alone with
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Excellency will permit us to inform
you,&rdquo; began Padre Salvi humbly, &ldquo;that Se&ntilde;or Ibarra
is excommunicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His Excellency cut short this speech, saying, &ldquo;I
am happy that I have only to regret the condition of Padre Damaso, for
whom I <i>sincerely</i> desire a <i>complete</i> recovery, since at his
age <i>a voyage to Spain</i> on account of his health may not be very
agreeable. But that depends on him! Meanwhile, may God preserve the
health of your Reverences!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And so much depends on him,&rdquo; murmured Padre
Salvi as they retired. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see who makes that voyage
soonest!&rdquo; remarked another Franciscan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall leave at once,&rdquo; declared the
indignant Padre Sibyla.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And we shall go back to our province,&rdquo; said
the Augustinians. Neither the Dominican nor the Augustinians could
endure the thought that they had been so coldly received on a
Franciscan&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p class="par">In the hall they met Ibarra, their amphitryon of a few
hours before, but no greetings were exchanged, only looks that said
many things. But when the friars had withdrawn the alcalde greeted him
familiarly, although the entrance of the aide looking for the young man
left no time for conversation. In the doorway he met Maria Clara; their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6730" href="#xd24e6730" name=
"xd24e6730">288</a>]</span>looks also said many things but quite
different from what the friars&rsquo; eyes had expressed.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra was dressed in deep mourning, but presented
himself serenely and made a profound bow, even though the visit of the
friars had not appeared to him to be a good augury. The Captain-General
advanced toward him several steps.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I take pleasure, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, in shaking
your hand. Permit me to receive you in all confidence.&rdquo; His
Excellency examined the youth with marked satisfaction.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir, such kindness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your surprise offends me, signifying as it does
that you had not expected to be well received. That is casting a doubt
on my sense of justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A cordial reception, sir, for an insignificant
subject of his Majesty like myself is not justice but a
favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good, good,&rdquo; exclaimed his Excellency,
seating himself and waving Ibarra to a chair. &ldquo;Let us enjoy a
brief period of frankness. I am very well satisfied with your conduct
and have already recommended you to his Majesty for a decoration on
account of your philanthropic idea of erecting a schoolhouse. If you
had let me know, I would have attended the ceremony with pleasure, and
perhaps might have prevented a disagreeable incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seemed to me such a small matter,&rdquo;
answered the youth, &ldquo;that I did not think it worth while
troubling your Excellency with it in the midst of your numerous cares.
Besides, my duty was to apply first to the chief authority of my
province.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His Excellency nodded with a satisfied air and went on
in an even more familiar tone: &ldquo;In regard to the trouble
you&rsquo;re had with Padre Damaso, don&rsquo;t hold any fear or
rancor, for they won&rsquo;t touch a hair of your head while I govern
the islands. As for the excommunication, I&rsquo;ll speak to the
Archbishop, since it is necessary for us to adjust ourselves to
circumstances. Here we can&rsquo;t laugh at such things in public as we
can in the Peninsula and in enlightened <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e6748" href="#xd24e6748" name="xd24e6748">289</a>]</span>Europe.
Nevertheless, be more prudent in the future. You have placed yourself
in opposition to the religious orders, who must be respected on account
of their influence and their wealth. But I will protect you, for I like
good sons, I like to see them honor the memory of their fathers. I
loved mine, and, as God lives, I don&rsquo;t know what I would have
done in your place!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then, changing the subject of conversation quickly, he
asked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told that you have just returned from Europe;
were you in Madrid?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir, several months.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps you heard my family spoken of?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Excellency had just left when I had the
honor of being introduced to your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How is it, then, that you came without bringing
any recommendations to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Ibarra with a bow,
&ldquo;because I did not come direct from Spain and because I have
heard your Excellency so well spoken of that I thought a letter of
recommendation might not only be valueless but even offensive; all
Filipinos are recommended to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A smile played about the old soldier&rsquo;s lips and he
replied slowly, as though measuring and weighing his words, &ldquo;You
flatter me by thinking so, and&mdash;so it ought to be. Nevertheless,
young man, you must know what burdens weigh upon our shoulders here in
the Philippines. Here we, old soldiers, have to do and to be
everything: King, Minister of State, of War, of Justice, of Finance, of
Agriculture, and of all the rest. The worst part of it too is that in
every matter we have to consult the distant mother country, which
accepts or rejects our proposals according to circumstances
there&mdash;and at times blindly. As we Spaniards say, &lsquo;He who
attempts many things succeeds in none.&rsquo; Besides, we generally
come here knowing little about the country and leave it when we begin
to get acquainted with it. With you I can be frank, for it would be
useless to try to be otherwise. Even in Spain, where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6765" href="#xd24e6765" name=
"xd24e6765">290</a>]</span>each department has its own minister, born
and reared in the locality, where there are a press and a public
opinion, where the opposition frankly opens the eyes of the government
and keeps it informed, everything moves along imperfectly and
defectively; thus it is a miracle that here things are not completely
topsyturvy in the lack of these safeguards, and having to live and work
under the shadow of a most powerful opposition. Good intentions are not
lacking to us, the governing powers, but we find ourselves obliged to
avail ourselves of the eyes and arms of others whom ordinarily we do
not know and who perhaps, instead of serving their country, serve only
their own private interests. This is not our fault but the fault of
circumstances&mdash;the friars aid us not a little in getting along,
but they are not sufficient. You have aroused my interest and it is my
desire that the imperfections of our present system of government be of
no hindrance to you. I cannot look after everybody nor can everybody
come to me. Can I be of service to you in any way? Have you no request
to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra reflected a moment before he answered.
&ldquo;Sir, my dearest wish is the happiness of my country, a happiness
which I desire to see owed to the mother country and to the efforts of
my fellow-citizens, the two united by the eternal bonds of common
aspirations and common interests. What I would request can only be
given by the government after years of unceasing toil and after the
introduction of definite reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His Excellency gazed at him for a few seconds with a
searching look, which Ibarra sustained with naturalness. &ldquo;You are
the first man that I&rsquo;ve talked to in this country!&rdquo; he
finally exclaimed, extending his hand.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your Excellency has seen only those who drag
themselves about in the city; you have not visited the slandered huts
of our towns or your Excellency would have been able to see real men,
if to be a man it is sufficient to have a generous heart and simple
customs.&rdquo;</p>

and began to walk back and forth in the room. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or
Ibarra,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pausing suddenly, and the young man also
rose, &ldquo;perhaps within a month I shall leave. Your education and
your mode of thinking are not for this country. Sell what you have,
pack your trunk, and come with me to Europe; the climate there will be
more agreeable to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall always while I live preserve the memory
of your Excellency&rsquo;s kindness,&rdquo; replied Ibarra with
emotion, &ldquo;but I must remain in this country where my fathers have
lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where they have died you might say with more
exactness! Believe me, perhaps I know your country better than you
yourself do. Ah, now I remember,&rdquo; he exclaimed with a change of
tone, &ldquo;you are going to marry an adorable young woman and
I&rsquo;m detaining you here! Go, go to her, and that you may have
greater freedom send her father to me,&rdquo; this with a smile.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, though, that I want you to accompany me in
my walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra bowed and withdrew. His Excellency then called to
his aide. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied,&rdquo; he said, slapping the
latter lightly on the shoulder. &ldquo;Today I&rsquo;ve seen for the
first time how it is possible for one to be a good Spaniard without
ceasing to be a good Filipino and to love his country. Today I showed
their Reverences that we are not all puppets of theirs. This young man
gave me the opportunity and I shall soon have settled all my accounts
with the friars. It&rsquo;s a pity that some day or other this young
man&mdash;But call the alcalde.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alcalde presented himself immediately. As he
entered, the Captain-General said to him, &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,
in order to avoid any repetition of <i>scenes</i> such as you
<i>witnessed</i> this afternoon, scenes that I regret, as they <i>hurt
the prestige</i> of the government and of all good Spaniards, allow me
to recommend to your <i>especial</i> care Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, so that
you may afford him means for carrying out his patriotic intentions and
also that in the future you prevent his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e6797" href="#xd24e6797" name="xd24e6797">292</a>]</span>being
molested by persons of any class whatsoever, under any pretext at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alcalde understood the reprimand and bowed to
conceal his confusion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have the same order communicated to the alferez
who commands in the district here. Also, investigate whether that
gentleman has affairs of his own that are not sanctioned by the
regulations. I&rsquo;ve heard more than one complaint in regard to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago presented himself stiff and formal.
&ldquo;Don Santiago,&rdquo; said his Excellency in an affable tone,
&ldquo;a little while ago I felicitated you on the happiness of having
a daughter such as the Se&ntilde;orita de los Santos; now let me
congratulate you on your future son-in-law. The most virtuous of
daughters is certainly worthy of the best citizen of the Philippines.
Is it permitted to know when the wedding will occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; stammered Capitan Tiago, wiping the
perspiration from his forehead.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come now, I see that there is nothing definitely
arranged. If persons are lacking to stand up with them, I shall take
the greatest pleasure in being one of them. That&rsquo;s for the
purpose of ridding myself of the feeling of disgust which the many
weddings I&rsquo;ve heretofore taken part in have given me,&rdquo; he
added, turning to the alcalde.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Capitan Tiago with a
smile that would move to pity.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra almost ran in search of Maria Clara&mdash;he had
so many things to tell her. Hearing merry voices in one of the rooms,
he knocked lightly on the door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked the voice of
Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The voices became hushed and the door&mdash;did not
open.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, may I come in?&rdquo; called the
young man, his heart beating violently.</p>
<p class="par">The silence continued. Then light footsteps approached
the door and the merry voice of Sinang murmured through <span class=

going to the theater tonight. Write what you have to say to
Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The footsteps retreated again as rapidly as they
approached.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; murmured Ibarra
thoughtfully as he retired slowly from the door. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Procession</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">At nightfall, when all the lanterns in the windows
had been lighted, for the fourth time the procession started amid the
ringing of bells and the usual explosions of bombs. The
Captain-General, who had gone out on foot in company with his two
aides, Capitan Tiago, the alcalde, the alferez, and Ibarra, preceded by
civil-guards and officials who opened the way and cleared the street,
was invited to review the procession from the house of the
gobernadorcillo, in front of which a platform had been erected where a
<i>loa</i><a class="noteref" id="xd24e6840src" href="#xd24e6840" name=
"xd24e6840src">1</a> would be recited in honor of the Blessed
Patron.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6862" href=
"#xd24e6862" name="xd24e6862">295</a>]</span>Ibarra would gladly have
renounced the pleasure of hearing this poetical composition, preferring
to watch the procession from Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house, where Maria
Clara had remained with some of her friends, but his Excellency wished
to hear the <i>loa</i>, so he had no recourse but to console himself
with the prospect of seeing her at the theater.</p>
<p class="par">The procession was headed by the silver candelabra borne
by three begloved sacristans, behind whom came the school children in
charge of their teacher, then boys with paper lanterns of varied shapes
and colors placed on the ends of bamboo poles of greater or less length
and decorated according to the caprice of each boy, since this
illumination was furnished by the children of the barrios, who gladly
performed this service, imposed by the <i>matanda sa
nayon</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6872src" href="#xd24e6872" name=
"xd24e6872src">2</a> each one designing and fashioning his own lantern,
adorning it as his fancy prompted and his finances permitted with a
greater or less number of frills and little streamers, and lighting it
with a piece of candle if he had a friend or relative who was a
sacristan, or if he could buy one of the small red tapers such as the
Chinese burn before their altars.</p>
<p class="par">In the midst of the crowd came and went alguazils,
guardians of justice to take care that the lines were not broken and
the people did not crowd together. For this purpose they availed
themselves of their rods, with blows from which, administered
opportunely and with sufficient force, they endeavored to add to the
glory and brilliance of the procession&mdash;all for the edification of
souls and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6877" href=
"#xd24e6877" name="xd24e6877">296</a>]</span>splendor of religious
show. At the same time that the alguazils were thus distributing free
their sanctifying blows, other persons, to console the recipients,
distributed candles and tapers of different sizes, also free.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rdquo; said Ibarra in a low
voice, &ldquo;do they administer those blows as a punishment for sin or
simply because they like to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Se&ntilde;or Ibarra,&rdquo;
answered the Captain-General, overhearing the question. &ldquo;This
barbarous sight is a wonder to all who come here from other countries.
It ought to be forbidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Without any apparent reason, the first saint that
appeared was <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;John the Baptist. On
looking at him it might have been said that the fame of Our
Savior&rsquo;s cousin did not amount to much among the people, for
while it is true that he had the feet and legs of a maiden and the face
of an anchorite, yet he was placed on an old wooden <i>andas</i>, and
was hidden by a crowd of children who, armed with candles and unlighted
lanterns, were engaging in mock fights.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Unfortunate saint!&rdquo; muttered the Sage
Tasio, who was watching the procession from the street, &ldquo;it
avails you nothing to have been the forerunner of the Good Tidings or
that Jesus bowed before you! Your great faith and your austerity avail
you nothing, nor the fact that you died for the truth and your
convictions, all of which men forget when they consider nothing more
than their own merits. It avails more to preach badly in the churches
than to be the eloquent voice crying in the desert, this is what the
Philippines teaches you! If you had eaten turkey instead of locusts and
had worn garments of silk rather than hides, if you had joined a
Corporation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the old man suspended his apostrophe at the approach
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
say so?&rdquo; he then went on, smiling sarcastically. &ldquo;This one
rides on a ear, and, good Heavens, what a car! How many lights and how
many glass lanterns! Never did I see you surrounded by so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6898" href="#xd24e6898" name=
"xd24e6898">297</a>]</span>many luminaries, Giovanni
Bernardone!<a class="noteref" id="xd24e6900src" href="#xd24e6900" name=
"xd24e6900src">3</a> And what music! Other tunes were heard by your
followers after your death! But, venerable and humble founder, if you
were to come back to life now you would see only degenerate Eliases of
Cortona, and if your followers should recognize you, they would put you
in jail, and perhaps you would share the fate of Cesareus of
Spyre.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After the music came a banner on which was pictured the
same saint, but with seven wings, carried by the Tertiary Brethren
dressed in <i>guing&oacute;n</i> habits and praying in high, plaintive
voices. Rather inexplicably, next came <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Mary Magdalene, a beautiful image with abundant
hair, wearing a pa&ntilde;uelo of embroidered pi&ntilde;a held by
fingers covered with rings, and a silk gown decorated with gilt
spangles. Lights and incense surrounded her while her glass tears
reflected the colors of the Bengal lights, which, while giving a
fantastic appearance to the procession, also made the saintly sinner
weep now green, now red, now blue tears. The houses did not begin to
light up until <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis was passing;
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;John the Baptist did not enjoy this
honor and passed hastily by as if ashamed to be the only one dressed in
hides in such a crowd of folk covered with gold and jewels.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There goes our saint!&rdquo; exclaimed the
daughter of the gobernadorcillo to her visitors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lent
him all my rings, but that&rsquo;s in order to get to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The candle-bearers stopped around the platform to listen
to the <i>loa</i> and the blessed saints did the same; either they or
their bearers wished to hear the verses. Those who were carrying
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;John, tired of waiting, squatted
down on their heels and agreed to set him on the ground.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alguazil may scold!&rdquo; objected one of
them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Huh, in the sacristy they leave him in a corner
among the cobwebs!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6936" href=
"#xd24e6936" name="xd24e6936">298</a>]</span>So <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;John, once on the ground, became one of the
townsfolk.</p>
<p class="par">As the Magdalene set out the women joined the
procession, only that instead of beginning with the children, as among
the men, the old women came first and the girls filled up the lines to
the car of the Virgin, behind which came the curate under his canopy.
This practise they had from Padre Damaso, who said: &ldquo;To the
Virgin the maidens and not the old women are pleasing!&rdquo; This
statement had caused wry faces on the part of many saintly old ladies,
but the Virgin did not change her tastes.</p>
<p class="par">San Diego followed the Magdalene but did not seem to be
rejoicing over this fact, since he moved along as repentantly as he had
in the morning when he followed <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Francis. His float was drawn by six Tertiary
Sisters&mdash;whether because of some vow or on account of some
sickness, the fact is that they dragged him along, and with zeal. San
Diego stopped in front of the platform and waited to be saluted.</p>
<p class="par">But it was necessary to wait for the float of the
Virgin, which was preceded by persons dressed like phantoms, who
frightened the little children so that there were heard the cries and
screams of terrified babies. Yet in the midst of that dark mass of
gowns, hoods, girdles, and nuns&rsquo; veils, from which arose a
monotonous and snuffling prayer, there were to be seen, like white
jasmines or fresh sampaguitas among old rags, twelve girls dressed in
white, crowned with flowers, their hair curled, and flashing from their
eyes glances as bright as their necklaces. Like little genii of light
who were prisoners of specters they moved along holding to the wide
blue ribbons tied to the Virgin&rsquo;s car and suggesting the doves
that draw the car of Spring.</p>
<p class="par">Now all the images were in attitudes of attention,
crowded one against the other to listen to the verses. Everybody kept
his eyes fixed on the half-drawn curtain until at length a sigh of
admiration escaped from the lips of all. Deservedly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6952" href="#xd24e6952" name=
"xd24e6952">299</a>]</span>so, too, for it was a boy with wings,
riding-boots, sash, belt, and plumed hat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the alcalde!&rdquo; cried some one,
but this prodigy of creation began to recite a poem like himself and
took no offense at the comparison.</p>
<p class="par">But why record here what he said in Latin, Tagalog, and
Spanish, all in verse&mdash;this poor victim of the gobernadorcillo?
Our readers have enjoyed Padre Damaso&rsquo;s sermon of the morning and
we do not wish to spoil them by too many wonders. Besides, the
Franciscan might feel hard toward us if we were to put forward a
competitor, and this is far from being the desire of such peaceful folk
as we have the good fortune to be.</p>
<p class="par">Afterwards, the procession moved on, <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;John proceeding along his vale of tears. When
the Virgin passed the house of Capitan Tiago a heavenly song greeted
her with the words of the archangel. It was a voice tender, melodious,
pleading, sighing out the <i>Ave Maria</i> of Gounod to the
accompaniment of a piano that prayed with it. The music of the
procession became hushed, the praying ceased, and even Padre Salvi
himself paused. The voice trembled and became plaintive, expressing
more than a salutation&mdash;rather a prayer and a protest.</p>
<p class="par">Terror and melancholy settled down upon Ibarra&rsquo;s
heart as he listened to the voice from the window where he stood. He
comprehended what that suffering soul was expressing in a song and yet
feared to ask himself the cause of such sorrow. Gloomy and thoughtful,
he turned to the Captain-General.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will join me at the table,&rdquo; the latter
said to him. &ldquo;There we&rsquo;ll talk about those boys who
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Could I be the cause?&rdquo; murmured the young
man, staring without seeing the Captain-General, whom he was following
mechanically. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6973" href=

metrical discourse for a special occasion or in honor of some
distinguished personage. Padre Zu&ntilde;iga (<i>Estadismo</i>, Chap.
III) thus describes one heard by him in Lipa, Batangas, in 1800, on the
occasion of General Alava&rsquo;s visit to that place: &ldquo;He who is
to recite the <i>loa</i> is seen in the center of the stage dressed as
a Spanish cavalier, reclining in a chair as if asleep, while behind the
scenes musicians sing a lugubrious chant in the vernacular. The sleeper
awakes and shows by signs that he thinks he has heard, or dreamed of
hearing, some voice. He again disposes himself to sleep, and the chant
is repeated in the same lugubrious tone. Again he awakes, rises, and
shows that he has heard a voice. This scene is repeated several times,
until at length he is persuaded that the voice is announcing the
arrival of the hero who is to be eulogized. He then commences to recite
his <i>loa</i>, carrying himself like a clown in a circus, while he
sings the praises of the person in whose honor the fiesta has been
arranged. This <i>loa</i>, which was in rhetorical verse in a diffuse
style suited to the Asiatic taste, set forth the general&rsquo;s naval
expeditions and the honors he had received from the King, concluding
with thanks and acknowledgment of the favor that he had conferred in
passing through their town and visiting such poor wretches as they.
There were not lacking in it the wanderings of Ulysses, the journeys of
Aristotle, the unfortunate death of Pliny, and other passages from
ancient history, which they delight in introducing into their stories.
All these passages are usually filled with fables touching upon the
marvelous, such as the following, which merit special <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6854" href="#xd24e6854" name=
"xd24e6854">295n</a>]</span>notice: of Aristotle it was said that being
unable to learn the depth of the sea he threw himself into its waves
and was drowned, and of Pliny that he leaped into Vesuvius to
investigate the fire within the volcano. In the same way other
historical accounts are confused. I believe that these <i>loas</i> were
introduced by the priests in former times, although the fables with
which they abound would seem to offer an objection to this opinion, as
nothing is ever told in them that can be found in the writings of any
European author; still they appear to me to have been suited to the
less critical taste of past centuries. The verses are written by the
natives, among whom there are many poets, this art being less difficult
in Tagalog than in any other language.&rdquo;&mdash;TR.&nbsp;<a class=

<h2 class="main">Do&ntilde;a Consolacion</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Why were the windows closed in the house of the
alferez? Where were the masculine features and the flannel camisa of
the Medusa or Muse of the Civil Guard while the procession was passing?
Had Do&ntilde;a Consolacion realized how disagreeable were her forehead
seamed with thick veins that appeared to conduct not blood but vinegar
and gall, and the thick cigar that made a fit ornament for her purple
lips, and her envious leer, and yielding to a generous impulse had she
wished not to disturb the pleasure of the populace by her sinister
appearance? Ah, for her generous impulses existed in the Golden Age!
The house, showed neither lanterns nor banners and was gloomy precisely
because the town was making merry, as Sinang said, and but for the
sentinel walking before the door appeared to be uninhabited.</p>
<p class="par">A dim light shone in the disordered sala, rendering
transparent the dirty concha-panes on which the cobwebs had fastened
and the dust had become incrusted. The lady of the house, according to
her indolent custom, was dozing on a wide sofa. She was dressed as
usual, that is, badly and horribly: tied round her head a
pa&ntilde;uelo, from beneath which escaped thin locks of tangled hair,
a camisa of blue flannel over another which must once have been white,
and a faded skirt which showed the outlines of her thin, flat thighs,
placed one over the other and shaking feverishly. From her mouth issued
little clouds of smoke which she puffed wearily in whatever direction
she happened to be looking when she opened her eyes. If at that moment
Don <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e6983" href="#xd24e6983" name=
"xd24e6983">301</a>]</span>Francisco de Ca&ntilde;amaque<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e6985src" href="#xd24e6985" name="xd24e6985src">1</a>
could have seen her, he would have taken her for a cacique of the town
or the <i>mankuk&uacute;lam</i>, and then decorated his discovery with
commentaries in the vernacular of the markets, invented by him for her
particular use.</p>
<p class="par">That morning she had not attended mass, not because she
had not so desired, for on the contrary she had wished to show herself
to the multitude and to hear the sermon, but her spouse had not
permitted her to do so, his refusal being accompanied as usual by two
or three insults, oaths, and threats of kicking. The alferez knew that
his mate dressed ridiculously and had the appearance of what is known
as a &ldquo;<i lang="es">querida</i> of the soldiers,&rdquo; so he did
not care to expose her to the gaze of strangers and persons from the
capital. But she did not so understand it. She knew that she was
beautiful and attractive, that she had the airs of a queen and dressed
much better and with more splendor than Maria Clara herself, who wore a
tapis while she went in a flowing skirt. It was therefore necessary for
the alferez to threaten her, &ldquo;Either shut up, or I&rsquo;ll kick
you back to your damned town!&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Consolacion did not
care to return to her town at the toe of a boot, but she meditated
revenge.</p>
<p class="par">Never had the dark face of this lady been such as to
inspire confidence in any one, not even when she painted, but that
morning it greatly worried the servants, especially when they saw her
move about the house from one part to another, silently, as if
meditating something terrible or malign. Her glance reflected the look
that springs from the eyes of a serpent when caught and about to be
crushed; it was cold, luminous, and penetrating, with something
fascinating, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7001" href="#xd24e7001"
name="xd24e7001">302</a>]</span>loathsome, and cruel in it. The most
insignificant error, the least unusual noise, drew from her a vile
insult that struck into the soul, but no one answered her, for to
excuse oneself would have been an additional fault.</p>
<p class="par">So the day passed. Not encountering any obstacle that
would block her way,&mdash;her husband had been invited out,&mdash;she
became saturated with bile, the cells of her whole organism seemed to
become charged with electricity which threatened to burst in a storm of
hate. Everything about her folded up as do the flowers at the first
breath of the hurricane, so she met with no resistance nor found any
point or high place to discharge her evil humor. The soldiers and
servants kept away from her. That she might not hear the sounds of
rejoicing outside she had ordered the windows closed and charged the
sentinel to let no one enter. She tied a handkerchief around her head
as if to keep it from bursting and, in spite of the fact that the sun
was still shining, ordered the lamps to be lighted.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa, as we saw, had been arrested as a disturber of the
peace and taken to the barracks. The alferez was not then present, so
the unfortunate woman had had to spend the night there seated on a
bench in an abandoned attitude. The next day the alferez saw her, and
fearing for her in those days of confusion nor caring to risk a
disagreeable scene, he had charged the soldiers to look after her, to
treat her kindly, and to give her something to eat. Thus the madwoman
spent two days.</p>
<p class="par">Tonight, whether the nearness to the house of Capitan
Tiago had brought to her Maria Clara&rsquo;s sad song or whether other
recollections awoke in her old melodies, whatever the cause, Sisa also
began to sing in a sweet and melancholy voice the
<i>kund&iacute;man</i> of her youth. The soldiers heard her and fell
silent; those airs awoke old memories of the days before they had been
corrupted. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion also heard them in her tedium, and
on learning who it was that sang, after a few moments of meditation,
ordered that Sisa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7012" href=
"#xd24e7012" name="xd24e7012">303</a>]</span>be brought to her
instantly. Something like a smile wandered over her dry lips.</p>
<p class="par">When Sisa was brought in she came calmly, showing
neither wonder nor fear. She seemed to see no lady or mistress, and
this wounded the vanity of the Muse, who endeavored to inspire respect
and fear. She coughed, made a sign to the soldiers to leave her, and
taking down her husband&rsquo;s whip, said to the crazy woman in a
sinister tone, &ldquo;Come on, <i>magcantar icau!</i>&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7019src" href="#xd24e7019" name=
"xd24e7019src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">Naturally, Sisa did not understand such Tagalog, and
this ignorance calmed the Medusa&rsquo;s wrath, for one of the
beautiful qualities of this lady was to try not to know Tagalog, or at
least to appear not to know it. Speaking it the worst possible, she
would thus give herself the air of a genuine <i>orofea</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7030src" href="#xd24e7030" name="xd24e7030src">3</a>
as she was accustomed to say. But she did well, for if she martyrized
Tagalog, Spanish fared no better with her, either in regard to grammar
or pronunciation, in spite of her husband, the chairs and the shoes,
all of which had done what they could to teach her.</p>
<p class="par">One of the words that had cost her more effort than the
hieroglyphics cost Champollion was the name <i>Filipinas</i>. The story
goes that on the day after her wedding, when she was talking with her
husband, who was then a corporal, she had said <i>Pilipinas</i>. The
corporal thought it his duty to correct her, so he said, slapping her
on the head, &ldquo;Say <i>Felipinas</i>, woman! Don&rsquo;t be stupid!
Don&rsquo;t you know that&rsquo;s what your damned country is called,
from <i>Felipe?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The woman, dreaming through her honeymoon, wished to
obey and said <i>Felepinas</i>. To the corporal it seemed that she was
getting nearer to it, so he increased the slaps and reprimanded her
thus: &ldquo;But, woman, can&rsquo;t you pronounce <i>Felipe?</i>
Don&rsquo;t forget it; you know the king, Don Felipe&mdash;the
fifth&mdash;. Say <i>Felipe</i>, and add to it <i>nas</i>, which in
Latin means &lsquo;islands of Indians,&rsquo; and you have the name of
your damned country!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7063" href=
"#xd24e7063" name="xd24e7063">304</a>]</span>Consolacion, at that time
a washerwoman, patted her bruises and repeated with symptoms of losing
her patience, &ldquo;Fe-li-pe, Felipe&mdash;nas, Fe-li-pe-nas,
Felipinas, so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The corporal saw visions. How could it be
<i>Felipenas</i> instead of <i>Felipinas?</i> One of two things: either
it was <i>Felipenas</i> or it was necessary to say <i>Felipi!</i> So
that day he very prudently dropped the subject. Leaving his wife, he
went to consult the books. Here his astonishment reached a climax: he
rubbed his eyes&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;slowly, now!
<i>F-i-l-i-p-i-n-a-s</i>, Filipinas! So all the well-printed books gave
it&mdash;neither he nor his wife was right!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Can
history lie? Doesn&rsquo;t this book say that Alonso Saavedra gave the
country that name in honor of the prince, Don Felipe? How was that name
corrupted? Can it be that this Alonso Saavedra was an
Indian?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7084src" href="#xd24e7084"
name="xd24e7084src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">With these doubts he went to consult the sergeant Gomez,
who, as a youth, had wanted to be a curate. Without deigning to look at
the corporal the sergeant blew out a mouthful of smoke and answered
with great pompousness, &ldquo;In ancient times it was pronounced
<i>Filipi</i> instead of <i>Felipe</i>. But since we moderns have
become Frenchified we can&rsquo;t endure two <i>i&rsquo;s</i> in
succession, so cultured people, especially in Madrid&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
never been in Madrid?&mdash;cultured people, as I say, have begun to
change the first <i>i</i> to <i>e</i> in many words. This is called
modernizing yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The poor corporal had never been in Madrid&mdash;here
was the cause of his failure to understand the riddle: what things are
learned in Madrid! &ldquo;So now it&rsquo;s proper to
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the ancient style, man! This country&rsquo;s
not yet cultured! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7111" href=
"#xd24e7111" name="xd24e7111">305</a>]</span>In the ancient style,
<i>Filipinas!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Gomez disdainfully.</p>
<p class="par">The corporal, even if he was a bad philologist, was yet
a good husband. What he had just learned his spouse must also know, so
he proceeded with her education: &ldquo;Consola, what do you call your
damned country?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What should I call it? Just what you taught me:
<i>Felifinas!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw a chair at you, you
&mdash;&mdash;! Yesterday you pronounced it even better in the modern
style, but now it&rsquo;s proper to pronounce it like an ancient:
<i>Feli</i>, I mean, <i>Filipinas!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Remember that I&rsquo;m no ancient! What are you
thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Never mind! Say <i>Filipinas!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;m no ancient
baggage, scarcely thirty years old!&rdquo; she replied, rolling up her
sleeves and preparing herself for the fray.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Say it, you &mdash;&mdash;, or I&rsquo;ll throw
this chair at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Consolacion saw the movement, reflected, then began to
stammer with heavy breaths, &ldquo;<i>Feli-, Fele-,
File&mdash;</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Pum! Crack! The chair finished the word. So the lesson
ended in fisticuffs, scratchings, slaps. The corporal caught her by the
hair; she grabbed his goatee, but was unable to bite because of her
loose teeth. He let out a yell, released her and begged her pardon.
Blood began to flow, one eye got redder than the other, a camisa was
torn into shreds, many things came to light, but not
<i>Filipinas</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Similar incidents occurred every time the question of
language came up. The corporal, watching her linguistic progress,
sorrowfully calculated that in ten years his mate would have completely
forgotten how to talk, and this was about what really came to pass.
When they were married she still knew Tagalog and could make herself
understood in Spanish, but now, at the time of our story, she no longer
spoke any language. She had become so addicted to expressing herself by
means of signs&mdash;and of these she chose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7155" href="#xd24e7155" name=
"xd24e7155">306</a>]</span>the loudest and most impressive&mdash;that
she could have given odds to the inventor of Volapuk.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa, therefore, had the good fortune not to understand
her, so the Medusa smoothed out her eyebrows a little, while a smile of
satisfaction lighted up her face; undoubtedly she did not know Tagalog,
she was an <i>orofea!</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Boy, tell her in Tagalog to sing! She
doesn&rsquo;t understand me, she doesn&rsquo;t understand
Spanish!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The madwoman understood the boy and began to sing the
<i>Song of the Night</i>. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion listened at first
with a sneer, which disappeared little by little from her lips. She
became attentive, then serious, and even somewhat thoughtful. The
voice, the sentiment in the lines, and the song itself affected
her&mdash;that dry and withered heart was perhaps thirsting for rain.
She understood it well: &ldquo;The sadness, the cold, and the moisture
that descend from the sky when wrapped in the mantle of night,&rdquo;
so ran the <i>kund&iacute;man</i>, seemed to be descending also on her
heart. &ldquo;The withered and faded flower which during the day
flaunted her finery, seeking applause and full of vanity, at eventide,
repentant and disenchanted, makes an effort to raise her drooping
petals to the sky, seeking a little shade to hide herself and die
without the mocking of the light that saw her in her splendor, without
seeing the vanity of her pride, begging also that a little dew should
weep upon her. The nightbird leaves his solitary retreat, the hollow of
an ancient trunk, and disturbs the sad loneliness of the open
places&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t sing!&rdquo; she exclaimed in
perfect Tagalog, as she rose with agitation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sing!
Those verses hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The crazy woman became silent. The boy ejaculated,
&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;!</i> She talks Tagalog!&rdquo; and stood staring
with admiration at his mistress, who, realizing that she had given
herself away, was ashamed of it, and as her nature was not that of a
woman, the shame took the aspect of rage and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7180" href="#xd24e7180" name=
"xd24e7180">307</a>]</span>hate; so she showed the door to the
imprudent boy and closed it behind him with a kick.</p>
<p class="par">Twisting the whip in her nervous hands, she took a few
turns around the room, then stopping suddenly in front of the crazy
woman, said to her in Spanish, &ldquo;Dance!&rdquo; But Sisa did not
move.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dance, dance!&rdquo; she repeated in a sinister
tone.</p>
<p class="par">The madwoman looked at her with wandering,
expressionless eyes, while the alfereza lifted one of her arms, then
the other, and shook them, but to no purpose, for Sisa did not
understand. Then she began to jump about and shake herself, encouraging
Sisa to imitate her. In the distance was to be heard the music of the
procession playing a grave and majestic march, but Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion danced furiously, keeping other time to other music
resounding within her. Sisa gazed at her without moving, while her eyes
expressed curiosity and something like a weak smile hovered around her
pallid lips: the lady&rsquo;s dancing amused her. The latter stopped as
if ashamed, raised the whip,&mdash;that terrible whip known to thieves
and soldiers, made in Ulango<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7188src" href=
"#xd24e7188" name="xd24e7188src">5</a> and perfected by the alferez
with twisted wires,&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn to
dance&mdash;dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She began to strike the madwoman&rsquo;s bare feet
gently with the whip. Sisa&rsquo;s face drew up with pain and she was
forced to protect herself with her hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aha, now you&rsquo;re starting!&rdquo; she
exclaimed with savage joy, passing from <i>lento</i> to <i>allegro
vivace</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The afflicted Sisa gave a cry of pain and quickly raised
her foot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to dance, you
Indian&mdash;!&rdquo; The whip swung and whistled.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa let herself fall to the floor and placed both hands
on her knees while she gazed at her tormentor with wildly-staring eyes.
Two sharp cuts of the whip on her shoulder made her stand up, and it
was not merely a cry but a howl <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e7207" href="#xd24e7207" name="xd24e7207">308</a>]</span>that the
unfortunate woman uttered. Her thin camisa was torn, her skin broken,
and the blood was flowing.</p>
<p class="par">The sight of blood arouses the tiger; the blood of her
victim aroused Do&ntilde;a Consolacion. &ldquo;Dance, damn you, dance!
Evil to the mother who bore you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Dance, or
I&rsquo;ll flog you to death!&rdquo; She then caught Sisa with one hand
and, whipping her with the other, began to dance about.</p>
<p class="par">The crazy woman at last understood and followed the
example by swinging her arms about awkwardly. A smile of satisfaction
curled the lips of her teacher, the smile of a female Mephistopheles
who succeeds in getting a great pupil. There were in it hate, disdain,
jest, and cruelty; with a burst of demoniacal laughter she could not
have expressed more.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, absorbed in the joy of the sight, she was not
aware of the arrival of her husband until he opened the door with a
loud kick. The alferez appeared pale and gloomy, and when he saw what
was going on he threw a terrible glance at his wife, who did not move
from her place but stood smiling at him cynically.</p>
<p class="par">The alferez put his hand as gently as he could on the
shoulder of the strange dancer and made her stop. The crazy woman
sighed and sank slowly to the floor covered with her own blood.</p>
<p class="par">The silence continued. The alferez breathed heavily,
while his wife watched him with questioning eyes. She picked up the
whip and asked in a smooth, soft voice, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter
with you? You haven&rsquo;t even wished me good evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez did not answer, but instead called the boy
and said to him, &ldquo;Take this woman away and tell Marta to get her
some other clothes and attend to her. You give her something to eat and
a good bed. Take care that she isn&rsquo;t ill-treated! Tomorrow
she&rsquo;ll be taken to Se&ntilde;or Ibarra&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he closed the door carefully, bolted it, and
approached <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7224" href="#xd24e7224"
name="xd24e7224">309</a>]</span>his wife. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tempting
me to kill you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, doubling up his fists.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; she
asked, rising and drawing away from him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me!&rdquo; he yelled
in a voice of thunder, letting out an oath and holding up before her a
sheet of paper covered with scrawls. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you write this
letter to the alcalde saying that I&rsquo;m bribed to permit gambling,
huh? I don&rsquo;t know why I don&rsquo;t beat you to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see you! Let&rsquo;s see you try it
if you dare!&rdquo; she replied with a jeering laugh. &ldquo;The one
who beats me to death has got to be more of a man than you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He heard the insult, but saw the whip. Catching up a
plate from the table, he threw it at her head, but she, accustomed to
such fights, dodged quickly and the plate was shattered against the
wall. A cup and saucer met with a similar fate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; she yelled; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
afraid to come near me!&rdquo; And to exasperate him the more, she spat
upon him.</p>
<p class="par">The alferez went blind from rage and with a roar
attempted to throw himself upon her, but she, with astonishing
quickness, hit him across the face with the whip and ran hurriedly into
an inner room, shutting and bolting the door violently behind her.
Bellowing with rage and pain, he followed, but was only able to run
against the door, which made him vomit oaths.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Accursed be your offspring, you sow! Open, open,
or I&rsquo;ll break your head!&rdquo; he howled, beating the door with
his hands and feet.</p>
<p class="par">No answer was heard, but instead the scraping of chairs
and trunks as if she was building a barricade with the furniture. The
house shook under the kicks and curses of the alferez.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in, don&rsquo;t come in!&rdquo;
called the sour voice inside. &ldquo;If you show yourself, I&rsquo;ll
shoot you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7246" href=
"#xd24e7246" name="xd24e7246">310</a>]</span>By degrees he appeared to
become calm and contented himself with walking up and down the room
like a wild beast in its cage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go out into the street and cool off your
head!&rdquo; the woman continued to jeer at him, as she now seemed to
have completed her preparations for defense.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I swear that if I catch you, even God won&rsquo;t
save you, you old sow!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, now you can say what you like. You
didn&rsquo;t want me to go to mass! You didn&rsquo;t let me attend to
my religious duties!&rdquo; she answered with such sarcasm as only she
knew how to use.</p>
<p class="par">The alferez put on his helmet, arranged his clothing a
little, and went out with heavy steps, but returned after a few minutes
without making the least noise, having taken off his shoes. The
servants, accustomed to these brawls, were usually bored, but this
novelty of the shoes attracted their attention, so they winked to one
another. The alferez sat down quietly in a chair at the side of the
Sublime Port and had the patience to wait for more than half an
hour.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you really gone out or are you still there,
old goat?&rdquo; asked the voice from time to time, changing the
epithets and raising the tone. At last she began to take away the
furniture piece by piece. He heard the noise and smiled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Boy, has your master gone out?&rdquo; cried
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion.</p>
<p class="par">At a sign from the alferez the boy answered, &ldquo;Yes,
se&ntilde;ora, he&rsquo;s gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A gleeful laugh was heard from her as she pulled back
the bolt. Slowly her husband arose, the door opened a little
way&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">A yell, the sound of a falling body, oaths, howls,
curses, blows, hoarse voices&mdash;who can tell what took place in the
darkness of that room?</p>
<p class="par">As the boy went out into the kitchen he made a
significant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7269" href="#xd24e7269"
name="xd24e7269">311</a>]</span>sign to the cook, who said to him,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I? In any case the whole town will! She asked me
if he had gone out, not if he had come back!&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ten o&rsquo;clock at night: the last rockets rose
lazily in the dark sky where a few paper balloons recently inflated
with smoke and hot air still glimmered like new stars. Some of those
adorned with fireworks took fire, threatening all the houses, so there
might be seen on the ridges of the roofs men armed with pails of water
and long poles with pieces of cloth on the ends. Their black
silhouettes stood out in the vague clearness of the air like phantoms
that had descended from space to witness the rejoicings of men. Many
pieces of fireworks of fantastic shapes&mdash;wheels, castles, bulls,
carabaos&mdash;had been set off, surpassing in beauty and grandeur
anything ever before seen by the inhabitants of San Diego.</p>
<p class="par">Now the people were moving in crowds toward the plaza to
attend the theater for the last time, Here and there might be seen
Bengal lights fantastically illuminating the merry groups while the
boys were availing themselves of torches to hunt in the grass for
unexploded bombs and other remnants that could still be used. But soon
the music gave the signal and all abandoned the open places.</p>
<p class="par">The great stage was brilliantly illuminated. Thousands
of lights surrounded the posts, hung from the roof, or sowed the floor
with pyramidal clusters. An alguazil was looking after these, and when
he came forward to attend to them the crowd shouted at him and
whistled, &ldquo;There he is! there he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In front of the curtain the orchestra players were
tuning their instruments and playing preludes of airs. Behind them was
the space spoken of by the correspondent in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7287" href="#xd24e7287" name=
"xd24e7287">313</a>]</span>letter, where the leading citizens of the
town, the Spaniards, and the rich visitors occupied rows of chairs. The
general public, the nameless rabble, filled up the rest of the place,
some of them bringing benches on their shoulders not so much for seats
as to make, up for their lack of stature. This provoked noisy protests
on the part of the benchless, so the offenders got down at once; but
before long they were up again as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="par">Goings and comings, cries, exclamations, bursts of
laughter, a serpent-cracker turned loose, a firecracker set
off&mdash;all contributed to swell the uproar. Here a bench had a leg
broken off and the people fell to the ground amid the laughter of the
crowd. They were visitors who had come from afar to observe and now
found themselves the observed. Over there they quarreled and disputed
over a seat, a little farther on was heard the noise of breaking glass;
it was Andeng carrying refreshments and drinks, holding the wide tray
carefully with both hands, but by chance she had met her sweetheart,
who tried to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p class="par">The teniente-mayor, Don Filipo, presided over the show,
as the gobernadorcillo was fond of monte. He was talking with old
Tasio. &ldquo;What can I do? The alcalde was unwilling to accept my
resignation. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel strong enough to attend to
your duties?&rsquo; he asked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How did you answer him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Se&ntilde;or Alcalde,&rsquo; I answered,
&lsquo;the strength of a teniente-mayor, however insignificant it may
be, is like all other authority it emanates from higher spheres. The
King himself receives his strength from the people and the people
theirs from God. That is exactly what I lack, Se&ntilde;or
Alcalde.&rsquo; But he did not care to listen to me, telling me that we
would talk about it after the fiesta.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then may God help you!&rdquo; said the old man,
starting away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thanks, no! For dreams and nonsense I am
sufficient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7304" href="#xd24e7304"
name="xd24e7304">314</a>]</span>unto myself,&rdquo; the Sage answered
with a sarcastic smile. &ldquo;But now I think of it, has your
attention never been drawn to the character of our people? Peaceful,
yet fond of warlike shows and bloody fights; democratic, yet adoring
emperors, kings, and princes; irreligious, yet impoverishing itself by
costly religious pageants. Our women have gentle natures yet go wild
with joy when a princess flourishes a lance. Do you know to what it is
due? Well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The arrival of Maria Clara and her friends put an end to
this conversation. Don Filipo met them and ushered them to their seats.
Behind them came the curate with another Franciscan and some Spaniards.
Following the priests were a number of the townsmen who make it their
business to escort the friars. &ldquo;May God reward them also in the
next life,&rdquo; muttered old Tasio as he went away.</p>
<p class="par">The play began with Chananay and Marianito in
<i>Crispino &eacute; la comare</i>. All now had their eyes and ears
turned to the stage, all but one: Padre Salvi, who seemed to have gone
there for no other purpose than that of watching Maria Clara, whose
sadness gave to her beauty an air so ideal and interesting that it was
easy to understand how she might be looked upon with rapture. But the
eyes of the Franciscan, deeply hidden in their sunken sockets, spoke
nothing of rapture. In that gloomy gaze was to be read something
desperately sad&mdash;with such eyes Cain might have gazed from afar on
the Paradise whose delights his mother pictured to him!</p>
<p class="par">The first scene was over when Ibarra entered. His
appearance caused a murmur, and attention was fixed on him and the
curate. But the young man seemed not to notice anything as he greeted
Maria Clara and her friends in a natural way and took a seat beside
them.</p>
<p class="par">The only one who spoke to him was Sinang. &ldquo;Did you
see the fireworks?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, little friend, I had to go with the
Captain-General.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a shame! The curate was with
us and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7321" href="#xd24e7321" name=
"xd24e7321">315</a>]</span>told us stories of the damned&mdash;can you
imagine it!&mdash;to fill us with fear so that we might not enjoy
ourselves&mdash;can you imagine it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The curate arose and approached Don Filipo, with whom he
began an animated conversation. The former spoke in a nervous manner,
the latter in a low, measured voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I can&rsquo;t please your
Reverence,&rdquo; said Don Filipo, &ldquo;but Se&ntilde;or Ibarra is
one of the heaviest contributors and has a right to be here as long as
he doesn&rsquo;t disturb the peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it disturbing the peace to
scandalize good Christians? It&rsquo;s letting a wolf enter the fold.
You will answer for this to God and the authorities!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I always answer for the actions that spring from
my own will, Padre,&rdquo; replied Don Filipo with a slight bow.
&ldquo;But my little authority does not empower me to mix in religious
affairs. Those who wish to avoid contact with him need not talk to him.
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra forces himself on no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s giving opportunity for danger, and
he who loves danger perishes in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any danger, Padre. The alcalde
and the Captain-General, my superior officers, have been talking with
him all the afternoon and it&rsquo;s not for me to teach them a
lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t put him out of here,
we&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I can&rsquo;t put any
one out of here.&rdquo; The curate repented of his threat, but it was
too late to retract, so he made a sign to his companion, who arose with
regret, and the two went out together. The persons attached to them
followed their example, casting looks of hatred at Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">The murmurs and whispers increased. A number of people
approached the young man and said to him, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re with you,
don&rsquo;t take any notice of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whom do you mean by <i>them?</i>&rdquo; Ibarra
asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7348" href=
"#xd24e7348" name="xd24e7348">316</a>]</span>&ldquo;Those who&rsquo;ve
just left to avoid contact with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Left to avoid contact with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, they say that you&rsquo;re
excommunicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Excommunicated?&rdquo; The astonished youth did
not know what to say. He looked about him and saw that Maria Clara was
hiding her face behind her fan. &ldquo;But is it possible?&rdquo; he
exclaimed finally. &ldquo;Are we still in the Dark Ages?
So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He approached the young women and said with a change of
tone, &ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;ve forgotten an engagement. I&rsquo;ll
be back to see you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; Sinang said to him. &ldquo;Yeyeng is
going to dance <i>La Calandria</i>. She dances divinely.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, little friend, but I&rsquo;ll be
back.&rdquo; The uproar increased.</p>
<p class="par">Yeyeng appeared fancifully dressed, with the
&ldquo;<i>Da ust&eacute; su permiso</i>?&rdquo; and Carvajal was
answering her, &ldquo;<i>Pase ust&eacute; adelante</i>,&rdquo; when two
soldiers of the Civil Guard went up to Don Filipo and ordered him to
stop the performance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the teniente-mayor in
surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because the alferez and his wife have been
fighting and can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell the alferez that we have permission from the
alcalde and that against such permission <i>no one</i> in the town has
any authority, not even the gobernadorcillo himself, and <i>he</i> is
my <i>only superior</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, the show must stop!&rdquo; repeated the
soldiers. Don Filipo turned his back and they went away. In order not
to disturb the merriment he told no one about the incident.</p>
<p class="par">After the selection of vaudeville, which was loudly
applauded, the Prince Villardo presented himself, challenging to mortal
combat the Moros who held his father prisoner. The hero threatened to
cut off all their heads at a single stroke and send them to the moon,
but fortunately for the Moros, who were disposing themselves for the
combat, a tumult arose. The orchestra suddenly ceased playing,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7393" href="#xd24e7393" name=
"xd24e7393">317</a>]</span>threw their instruments away, and jumped up
on the stage. The valiant Villardo, not expecting them and taking them
for allies of the Moros, dropped his sword and shield, and started to
run. The Moros, seeing that such a doughty Christian was fleeing, did
not consider it improper to imitate him. Cries, groans, prayers, oaths
were heard, while the people ran and pushed one another about. The
lights were extinguished, blazing lamps were thrown into the air.
&ldquo;Tulisanes! Tulisanes!&rdquo; cried some. &ldquo;Fire, fire!
Robbers!&rdquo; shouted others. Women and children wept, benches and
spectators were rolled together on the ground amid the general
pandemonium.</p>
<p class="par">The cause of all this uproar was two civil-guards, clubs
in hand, chasing the musicians in order to break up the performance.
The teniente-mayor, with the aid of the cuadrilleros, who were armed
with old sabers, managed at length to arrest them, in spite of their
resistance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take them to the town hall!&rdquo; cried Don
Filipo. &ldquo;Take care that they don&rsquo;t get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra had returned to look for Maria Clara. The
frightened girls clung to him pale and trembling while Aunt Isabel
recited the Latin litany.</p>
<p class="par">When the people were somewhat calmed down from their
fright and had learned the cause of the disturbance, they were beside
themselves with indignation. Stones rained on the squad of cuadrilleros
who were conducting the two offenders from the scene, and there were
even those who proposed to set fire to the barracks of the Civil Guard
so as to roast Do&ntilde;a Consolacion along with the alferez.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re good for!&rdquo;
cried a woman, doubling up her fists and stretching out her arms.
&ldquo;To disturb the town! They don&rsquo;t chase any but honest
folks! Out yonder are the tulisanes and the gamblers. Let&rsquo;s set
fire to the barracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">One man was beating himself on the arm and begging for
confession. Plaintive sounds issued from under the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7408" href="#xd24e7408" name=
"xd24e7408">318</a>]</span>overturned benches&mdash;it was a poor
musician. The stage was crowded with actors and spectators, all talking
at the same time. There was Chananay dressed as Leonor in <i>Il
Trovatore</i>, talking in the language of the markets to Ratia in the
costume of a schoolmaster; Yeyeng, wrapped in a silk shawl, was
clinging to the Prince Villardo; while Balbino and the Moros were
exerting themselves to console the more or less injured
musicians.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7413src" href="#xd24e7413" name=
"xd24e7413src">1</a> Several Spaniards went from group to group
haranguing every one they met.</p>
<p class="par">A large crowd was forming, whose intention Don Filipo
seemed to be aware of, for he ran to stop them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
disturb the peace!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll ask for
an accounting and we&rsquo;ll get justice. I&rsquo;ll answer for it
that we get justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the reply of several. &ldquo;They
did the same thing in Kalamba,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7420src"
href="#xd24e7420" name="xd24e7420src">2</a> the same promise was made,
but the alcalde did nothing. We&rsquo;ll take the law into our own
hands! To the barracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In vain the teniente-mayor pleaded with them. The crowd
maintained its hostile attitude, so he looked about him for help and
noticed Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, as a favor! Restrain them
while I get some cuadrilleros.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; asked the perplexed youth,
but the teniente-mayor was already at a distance. He gazed about him
seeking he knew not whom, when accidentally he discerned Elias, who
stood impassively watching the disturbance.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra ran to him, caught him by the arm, and said to
him in Spanish: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, do something, if you can!
I can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; The pilot must have understood him,
for he disappeared in the crowd. Lively disputes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7434" href="#xd24e7434" name=
"xd24e7434">319</a>]</span>and sharp exclamations were heard. Gradually
the crowd began to break up, its members each taking a less hostile
attitude. It was high time, indeed, for the soldiers were already
rushing out armed and with fixed bayonets.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, what had the curate been doing? Padre Salvi
had not gone to bed but had stood motionless, resting his forehead
against the curtains and gazing toward the plaza. From time to time a
suppressed sigh escaped him, and if the light of the lamp had not been
so dim, perhaps it would have been possible to see his eyes fill with
tears. Thus nearly an hour passed.</p>
<p class="par">The tumult in the plaza awoke him from his reverie. With
startled eyes he saw the confused movements of the people, while their
voices came up to him faintly. A breathless servant informed him of
what was happening. A thought shot across his mind: in the midst of
confusion and tumult is the time when libertines take advantage of the
consternation and weakness of woman. Every one seeks to save himself,
no one thinks of any one else; a cry is not heard or heeded, women
faint, are struck and fall, terror and fright heed not shame, under the
cover of night&mdash;and when they are in love! He imagined that he saw
Crisostomo snatch the fainting Maria Clara up in his arms and disappear
into the darkness. So he went down the stairway by leaps and bounds,
and without hat or cane made for the plaza like a madman. There he met
some Spaniards who were reprimanding the soldiers, but on looking
toward the seats that the girls had occupied he saw that they were
vacant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre! Padre!&rdquo; cried the Spaniards, but he
paid no attention to them as he ran in the direction of Capitan
Tiago&rsquo;s. There he breathed more freely, for he saw in the open
hallway the adorable silhouette, full of grace and soft in outline, of
Maria Clara, and that of the aunt carrying cups and glasses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;it seems that she
has been taken sick only.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7446" href=
"#xd24e7446" name="xd24e7446">320</a>]</span>Aunt Isabel at that moment
closed the windows and the graceful shadow was no longer to be seen.
The curate moved away without heeding the crowd. He had before his eyes
the beautiful form of a maiden sleeping and breathing sweetly. Her
eyelids were shaded by long lashes which formed graceful curves like
those of the Virgins of Raphael, the little mouth was smiling, all the
features breathed forth virginity, purity, and innocence. That
countenance formed a sweet vision in the midst of the white coverings
of her bed like the head of a cherub among the clouds. His imagination
went still further&mdash;but who can write what a burning brain can
imagine?</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps only the newspaper correspondent, who concluded
his account of the fiesta and its accompanying incidents in the
following manner:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A thousand thanks, infinite thanks, to the
opportune and active intervention of the Very Reverend Padre Fray
Bernardo Salvi, who, defying every danger in the midst of the unbridled
mob, without hat or cane, calmed the wrath of the crowd, using only his
persuasive word with the majesty and authority that are never lacking
to a minister of a Religion of Peace. With unparalleled self-abnegation
this virtuous priest tore himself from sweet repose, such as every good
conscience like his enjoys, and rushed to protect his flock from the
least harm. The people of San Diego will hardly forget this sublime
deed of their heroic Pastor, remembering to hold themselves grateful to
him for all eternity!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7452"

<p class="par first">Ibarra was in such a state of mind that he found
it impossible to sleep, so to distract his attention from the sad
thoughts which are so exaggerated during the night-hours he set to work
in his lonely cabinet. Day found him still making mixtures and
combinations, to the action of which he subjected pieces of bamboo and
other substances, placing them afterwards in numbered and sealed
jars.</p>
<p class="par">A servant entered to announce the arrival of a man who
had the appearance of being from the country. &ldquo;Show him
in,&rdquo; said Ibarra without looking around.</p>
<p class="par">Elias entered and remained standing in silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra in
Tagalog when he recognized him. &ldquo;Excuse me for making you wait, I
didn&rsquo;t notice that it was you. I&rsquo;m making an important
experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to disturb you,&rdquo;
answered the youthful pilot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come first to ask you if
there is anything I can do for you in the province, of Batangas, for
which I am leaving immediately, and also to bring you some bad
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra questioned him with a look.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s daughter is ill,&rdquo;
continued Elias quietly, &ldquo;but not seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I feared,&rdquo; murmured
Ibarra in a weak voice. &ldquo;Do you know what is the matter with
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A fever. Now, if you have nothing to
command&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thank you, my friend, no. I wish you a pleasant
journey. But first let me ask you a question&mdash;if it is indiscreet,
do not answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias bowed.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7482" href=
"#xd24e7482" name="xd24e7482">322</a>]</span>&ldquo;How were you able
to quiet the disturbance last night?&rdquo; asked Ibarra, looking
steadily at him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very easily,&rdquo; answered Elias in the most
natural manner. &ldquo;The leaders of the commotion were two brothers
whose father died from a beating given him by the Civil Guard. One day
I had the good fortune to save them from the same hands into which
their father had fallen, and both are accordingly grateful to me. I
appealed to them last night and they undertook to dissuade the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And those two brothers whose father died from the
beating&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Will end as their father did,&rdquo; replied
Elias in a low voice. &ldquo;When misfortune has once singled out a
family all its members must perish,&mdash;when the lightning strikes a
tree the whole is reduced to ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra fell silent on hearing this, so Elias took his
leave. When the youth found himself alone he lost the serene
self-possession he had maintained in the pilot&rsquo;s presence. His
sorrow pictured itself on his countenance. &ldquo;I, I have made her
suffer,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p class="par">He dressed himself quickly and descended the stairs. A
small man, dressed in mourning, with a large scar on his left cheek,
saluted him humbly, and detained him on his way.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir, my name is Lucas, and I&rsquo;m the brother
of the man who was killed yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, you have my sympathy. Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir, I want to know how much you&rsquo;re going
to pay my brother&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pay?&rdquo; repeated the young man, unable to
conceal his disgust. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk of that later. Come back
this afternoon, I&rsquo;m in a hurry now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only tell me how much you&rsquo;re willing to
pay,&rdquo; insisted Lucas.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you that we&rsquo;ll talk about
that some other time. I haven&rsquo;t time now,&rdquo; repeated Ibarra
impatiently.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7510" href=
"#xd24e7510" name="xd24e7510">323</a>]</span>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
time now, sir?&rdquo; asked Lucas bitterly, placing himself in front of
the young man. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t time to consider the
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come this afternoon, my good man,&rdquo; replied
Ibarra, restraining himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way now to visit a
sick person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, for the sick you forget the dead? Do you
think that because we are poor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra looked at him and interrupted, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
try my patience!&rdquo; then went on his way.</p>
<p class="par">Lucas stood looking after him with a smile full of hate.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to see that you&rsquo;re the grandson of the man
who tied my father out in the sun,&rdquo; he muttered between his
teeth. &ldquo;You still have the same blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then with a change of tone he added, &ldquo;But, if you
pay well&mdash;friends!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7522"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The fiesta is over. The people of the town have
again found, as in every other year, that their treasury is poorer,
that they have worked, sweated, and stayed awake much without really
amusing themselves, without gaining any new friends, and, in a word,
that they have dearly bought their dissipation and their headaches. But
this matters nothing, for the same will be done next year, the same the
coming century, since it has always been the custom.</p>
<p class="par">In Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house sadness reigns. All the
windows are closed, the inmates move about noiselessly, and only in the
kitchen do they dare to speak in natural tones. Maria Clara, the soul
of the house, lies sick in bed and her condition is reflected in all
the faces, as the sorrows of the mind may be read in the countenance of
an individual.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Which seems best to you, Isabel, shall I make a
poor-offering to the cross of Tunasan or to the cross of
Matahong?&rdquo; asks the afflicted father in a low voice. &ldquo;The
Tunasan cross grows while the Matahong cross sweats which do you think
is more miraculous?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aunt Isabel reflects, shakes her head, and murmurs,
&ldquo;To grow, to grow is a greater miracle than to sweat. All of us
sweat, but not all of us grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Isabel; but remember that to
sweat for the wood of which bench-legs are made to sweat&mdash;is not a
small miracle. Come, the best thing will be to make poor-offerings to
both crosses, so neither will resent it, and Maria will get better
sooner. Are the rooms ready? You <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e7538" href="#xd24e7538" name="xd24e7538">325</a>]</span>know that
with the doctors is coming a new gentleman, a distant relative of Padre
Damaso&rsquo;s. Nothing should be lacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At the other end of the dining-room are the two cousins,
Sinang and Victoria, who have come to keep the sick girl company.
Andeng is helping them clean a silver tea-set.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know Dr. Espada&ntilde;a?&rdquo; the
foster-sister of Maria Clara asks Victoria curiously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replies the latter, &ldquo;the only
thing that I know about him is that he charges high, according to
Capitan Tiago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then he must be good!&rdquo; exclaims Andeng.
&ldquo;The one who performed an operation on Do&ntilde;a Maria charged
high; so he was learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; retorts Sinang. &ldquo;Every one
who charges high is not learned. Look at Dr. Guevara; after performing
a bungling operation that cost the life of both mother and child, he
charged the widower fifty pesos. The thing to know is how to
charge!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; asks her
cousin, nudging her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know? The husband, who is a poor
sawyer, after losing his wife had to lose his home also, for the
alcalde, being a friend of the doctor&rsquo;s, made him pay.
Don&rsquo;t I know about it, when my father lent him the money to make
the journey to Santa Cruz?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7555src"
href="#xd24e7555" name="xd24e7555src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The sound of a carriage stopping in front of the house
put an end to these conversations. Capitan Tiago, followed by Aunt
Isabel, ran down the steps to welcome the new arrivals: the Doctor Don
Tiburcio de Espada&ntilde;a, his se&ntilde;ora the <i>Doctora</i>
Do&ntilde;a Victorina de los Reyes <i>de</i> De Espada&ntilde;a, and a
young Spaniard of pleasant countenance and agreeable aspect.</p>
<p class="par">Do&ntilde;a Victorina was attired in a loose silk gown
embroidered with flowers and a hat with a huge parrot half-crushed
between blue and red ribbons. The dust of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7571" href="#xd24e7571" name=
"xd24e7571">326</a>]</span>road mingled with the rice-powder on her
cheeks seemed to accentuate her wrinkles. As at the time we saw her in
Manila, she now supported her lame husband on her arm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have the pleasure of introducing to you our
cousin, Don Alfonso Linares de Espada&ntilde;a,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, indicating their young companion. &ldquo;The gentleman is a
godson of a relative of Padre Damaso&rsquo;s and has been private
secretary to all the ministers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The young man bowed politely and Capitan Tiago came very
near to kissing his hand.</p>
<p class="par">While their numerous trunks and traveling-bags are being
carried in and Capitan Tiago is conducting them to their rooms, let us
talk a little of this couple whose acquaintance we made slightly in the
first chapters.</p>
<p class="par">Do&ntilde;a Victorina was a lady of forty and five
winters, which were equivalent to thirty and two summers according to
her arithmetical calculations. She had been beautiful in her youth,
having had, as she used to say, &lsquo;good flesh,&rsquo; but in the
ecstasies of contemplating herself she had looked with disdain on her
many Filipino admirers, since her aspirations were toward another race.
She had refused to bestow on any one her little white hand, not indeed
from distrust, for not a few times had she given jewelry and gems of
great value to various foreign and Spanish adventurers. Six months
before the time of our story she had seen realized her most beautiful
dream,&mdash;the dream of her whole life,&mdash;for which she might
scorn the fond illusions of her youth and even the promises of love
that Capitan Tiago had in other days whispered in her ear or sung in
some serenade. Late, it is true, had the dream been realized, but
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, who, although she spoke the language badly, was
more Spanish than Augustina of Saragossa,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7581src" href="#xd24e7581" name="xd24e7581src">2</a> understood
the proverb, &ldquo;Better late than never,&rdquo; and found
consolation in repeating it to herself. &ldquo;Absolute happiness does
not exist on earth,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7584"
href="#xd24e7584" name="xd24e7584">327</a>]</span>was another favorite
proverb of hers, but she never used both together before other
persons.</p>
<p class="par">Having passed her first, second, third, and fourth youth
in casting her nets in the sea of the world for the object of her
vigils, she had been compelled at last to content herself with what
fate was willing to apportion her. Had the poor woman been only thirty
and one instead of thirty and two summers&mdash;the difference
according to her mode of reckoning was great&mdash;she would have
restored to Destiny the award it offered her to wait for another more
suited to her taste, but since man proposes and necessity disposes, she
saw herself obliged in her great need for a husband to content herself
with a poor fellow who had been cast out from Estremadura<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7588src" href="#xd24e7588" name="xd24e7588src">3</a>
and who, after wandering about the world for six or seven years like a
modern Ulysses, had at last found on the island of Luzon hospitality
and a withered Calypso for his better half. This unhappy mortal, by
name Tiburcio Espada&ntilde;a, was only thirty-five years of age and
looked like an old man, yet he was, nevertheless, younger than
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, who was only thirty-two. The reason for this is
easy to understand but dangerous to state.</p>
<p class="par">Don Tiburcio had come to the Philippines as a petty
official in the Customs, but such had been his bad luck that, besides
suffering severely from seasickness and breaking a leg during the
voyage, he had been dismissed within a fortnight, just at the time when
he found himself without a cuarto. After his rough experience on the
sea he did not care to return to Spain without having made his fortune,
so he decided to devote himself to something. Spanish pride forbade him
to engage in manual labor, although the poor fellow would gladly have
done any kind of work in order to earn an honest living. But the
prestige of the Spaniards would not have allowed it, even though this
prestige did not protect him from want.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7595" href=
"#xd24e7595" name="xd24e7595">328</a>]</span>At first he had lived at
the expense of some of his countrymen, but in his honesty the bread
tasted bitter, so instead of getting fat he grew thin. Since he had
neither learning nor money nor recommendations he was advised by his
countrymen, who wished to get rid of him, to go to the provinces and
pass himself off as a doctor of medicine. He refused at first, for he
had learned nothing during the short period that he had spent as an
attendant in a hospital, his duties there having been to dust off the
benches and light the fires. But as his wants were pressing and as his
scruples were soon laid to rest by his friends he finally listened to
them and went to the provinces. He began by visiting some sick persons,
and at first made only moderate charges, as his conscience dictated,
but later, like the young philosopher of whom Samaniego<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e7597src" href="#xd24e7597" name="xd24e7597src">4</a>
tells, he ended by putting a higher price on his visits. Thus he soon
passed for a great physician and would probably have made his fortune
if the medical authorities in Manila had not heard of his exorbitant
fees and the competition that he was causing others. Both private
parties and professionals interceded for him. &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; they
said to the zealous medical official, &ldquo;let him make his stake and
as soon as he has six or seven thousand pesos he can go back home and
live there in peace. After all, what does it matter to you if he does
deceive the unwary Indians? They should be more careful! He&rsquo;s a
poor devil&mdash;don&rsquo;t take the bread from his mouth&mdash;be a
good Spaniard!&rdquo; This official was a good Spaniard and agreed to
wink at the matter, but the news soon reached the ears of the people
and they began to distrust him, so in a little while he lost his
practise and again saw himself obliged almost to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7614" href="#xd24e7614" name=
"xd24e7614">329</a>]</span>beg his daily bread. It was then that he
learned through a friend, who was an intimate acquaintance of
Do&ntilde;a Victorina&rsquo;s, of the dire straits in which that lady
was placed and also of her patriotism and her kind heart. Don Tiburcio
then saw a patch of blue sky and asked to be introduced to her.</p>
<p class="par">Do&ntilde;a Victorina and Don Tiburcio met: <i>tarde
venientibus ossa</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7621src" href=
"#xd24e7621" name="xd24e7621src">5</a> he would have exclaimed had he
known Latin! She was no longer passable, she was pass&eacute;e. Her
abundant hair had been reduced to a knot about the size of an onion,
according to her maid, while her face was furrowed with wrinkles and
her teeth were falling loose. Her eyes, too, had suffered considerably,
so that she squinted frequently in looking any distance. Her
disposition was the only part of her that remained intact.</p>
<p class="par">At the end of a half-hour&rsquo;s conversation they
understood and accepted each other. She would have preferred a Spaniard
who was less lame, less stuttering, less bald, less toothless, who
slobbered less when he talked, and who had more &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;
and &ldquo;quality,&rdquo; as she used to say, but that class of
Spaniards no longer came to seek her hand. She had more than once heard
it said that opportunity is pictured as being bald, and firmly believed
that Don Tiburcio was opportunity itself, for as a result of his
misfortunes he suffered from premature baldness. And what woman is not
prudent at thirty-two years of age?</p>
<p class="par">Don Tiburcio, for his part, felt a vague melancholy when
he thought of his honeymoon, but smiled with resignation and called to
his support the specter of hunger. Never had he been ambitious or
pretentious; his tastes were simple and his desires limited; but his
heart, untouched till then, had dreamed of a very different divinity.
Back there in his youth when, worn out with work, he lay doom on his
rough bed after a frugal meal, he used to fall asleep dreaming of an
image, smiling and tender. Afterwards, when troubles and privations
increased and with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7628" href=
"#xd24e7628" name="xd24e7628">330</a>]</span>passing of years the
poetical image failed to materialize, he thought modestly of a good
woman, diligent and industrious, who would bring him a small dowry, to
console him for the fatigues of his toil and to quarrel with him now
and then&mdash;yes, he had thought of quarrels as a kind of happiness!
But when obliged to wander from land to land in search not so much of
fortune as of some simple means of livelihood for the remainder of his
days; when, deluded by the stories of his countrymen from overseas, he
had set out for the Philippines, realism gave, place to an arrogant
mestiza or a beautiful Indian with big black eyes, gowned in silks and
transparent draperies, loaded down with gold and diamonds, offering him
her love, her carriages, her all. When he reached Manila he thought for
a time that his dream was to be realized, for the young women whom he
saw driving on the Luneta and the Malecon in silver-mounted carriages
had gazed at him with some curiosity. Then after his position was gone,
the mestiza and the Indian disappeared and with great effort he forced
before himself the image of a widow, of course an agreeable widow! So
when he saw his dream take shape in part he became sad, but with a
certain touch of native philosophy said to himself, &ldquo;Those were
all dreams and in this world one does not live on dreams!&rdquo; Thus
he dispelled his doubts: she used rice-powder, but after their marriage
he would break her of the habit; her face had many wrinkles, but his
coat was torn and patched; she was a pretentious old woman, domineering
and mannish, but hunger was more terrible, more domineering and
pretentious still, and anyway, he had been blessed with a mild
disposition for that very end, and love softens the character. She
spoke Spanish badly, but he himself did not talk it well, as he had
been told when notified of his dismissal Moreover, what did it matter
to him if she was an ugly and ridiculous old woman? He was lame,
toothless, and bald! Don Tiburcio preferred to take charge of her
rather than to become a public charge from hunger. When some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7630" href="#xd24e7630" name=
"xd24e7630">331</a>]</span>friends joked with him about it, he
answered, &ldquo;Give me bread and call me a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Don Tiburcio was one of those men who are popularly
spoken of as unwilling to harm a fly. Modest, incapable of harboring an
unkind thought, in bygone days he would have been made a missionary.
His stay in the country had not given him the conviction of grand
superiority, of great valor, and of elevated importance that the
greater part of his countrymen acquire in a few weeks. His heart had
never been capable of entertaining hate nor had he been able to find a
single filibuster; he saw only unhappy wretches whom he must despoil if
he did not wish to be more unhappy than they were. When he was
threatened with prosecution for passing himself off as a physician he
was not resentful nor did he complain. Recognizing the justness of the
charge against him, he merely answered, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s necessary
to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So they married, or rather, bagged each other, and went
to Santa Ann to spend their honeymoon. But on their wedding-night
Do&ntilde;a Victorina was attacked by a horrible indigestion and Don
Tiburcio thanked God and showed himself solicitous and attentive. A few
days afterward, however, he looked into a mirror and smiled a sad smile
as he gazed at his naked gums, for he had aged ten years at least.</p>
<p class="par">Very well satisfied with her husband, Do&ntilde;a
Victorina had a fine set of false teeth made for him and called in the
best tailors of the city to attend to his clothing. She ordered
carriages, sent to Batangas and Albay for the best ponies, and even
obliged him to keep a pair for the races. Nor did she neglect her own
person while she was transforming him. She laid aside the native
costume for the European and substituted false frizzes for the simple
Filipino coiffure, while her gowns, which fitted her marvelously ill,
disturbed the peace of all the quiet neighborhood.</p>
<p class="par">Her husband, who never went out on foot,&mdash;she did
not care to have his lameness noticed,&mdash;took her on lonely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7640" href="#xd24e7640" name=
"xd24e7640">332</a>]</span>drives in unfrequented places to her great
sorrow, for she wanted to show him off in public, but she kept quiet
out of respect for their honeymoon. The last quarter was coming on when
he took up the subject of the rice-powder, telling her that the use of
it was false and unnatural. Do&ntilde;a Victorina wrinkled up her
eyebrows and stared at his false teeth. He became silent, and she
understood his weakness.</p>
<p class="par">She placed a <i>de</i> before her husband&rsquo;s
surname, since the <i>de</i> cost nothing and gave
&ldquo;quality&rdquo; to the name, signing herself &ldquo;Victorina de
los Reyes <i>de</i> De Espada&ntilde;a.&rdquo; This <i>de</i> was such
a mania with her that neither the stationer nor her husband could get
it out of her head. &ldquo;If I write only one <i>de</i> it may be
thought that you don&rsquo;t have it, you fool!&rdquo; she said to her
husband.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7660src" href="#xd24e7660" name=
"xd24e7660src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">Soon she believed that she was about to become a mother,
so she announced to all her acquaintances, &ldquo;Next month De
Espada&ntilde;a and I are going to the <i>Penyinsula</i>. I don&rsquo;t
want our son to be born here and be called a revolutionist.&rdquo; She
talked incessantly of the journey, having memorized the names of the
different ports of call, so that it was a treat to hear her talk:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see the isthmus in the Suez Canal&mdash;De
Espada&ntilde;a thinks it very beautiful and De Espada&ntilde;a has
traveled over the whole world.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably not
return to this land of savages.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t born to
live here&mdash;Aden or Port Said would suit me better&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
thought so ever since I was a girl.&rdquo; In her geography Do&ntilde;a
Victorina divided the world into the Philippines and Spain; rather
differently from the clever people who divide it into Spain and America
or China for another name.</p>
<p class="par">Her husband realized that these things were barbarisms,
but held his peace to escape a scolding or reminders of his stuttering.
To increase the illusion of approaching maternity she became whimsical,
dressed herself in colors with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7676"
href="#xd24e7676" name="xd24e7676">333</a>]</span>a profusion of
flowers and ribbons, and appeared on the Escolta in a wrapper. But oh,
the disenchantment! Three months went by and the dream faded, and now,
having no reason for fearing that her son would be a revolutionist, she
gave up the trip. She consulted doctors, midwives, old women, but all
in vain. Having to the great displeasure of Capitan Tiago jested about
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Pascual Bailon, she was unwilling
to appeal to any saint. For this reason a friend of her husband&rsquo;s
remarked to her:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Believe me, se&ntilde;ora, you are the only
<i>strong-spirited</i> person in this tiresome country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She had smiled, without knowing what
<i>strong-spirited</i> meant, but that night she asked her husband.
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the s-strongest s-spirit
that I know of is ammonia. My f-friend must have s-spoken
f-figuratively.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After that she would say on every possible occasion,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only ammonia in this tiresome country, speaking
figuratively. So Se&ntilde;or N. de N., a Peninsular gentleman of
quality, told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Whatever she said had to be done, for she had succeeded
in dominating her husband completely. He on his part did not put up any
great resistance and so was converted into a kind of lap-dog of hers.
If she was displeased with him she would not let him go out, and when
she was really angry she tore out his false teeth, thus leaving him a
horrible sight for several days.</p>
<p class="par">It soon occurred to her that her husband ought to be a
doctor of medicine and surgery, and she so informed him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My dear, do you w-want me to be arrested?&rdquo;
he asked fearfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool! Leave me to arrange
it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to treat any
one, but I want people to call you <i>Doctor</i> and me <i>Doctora</i>,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So on the following day Rodoreda<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7710src" href="#xd24e7710" name="xd24e7710src">7</a> received an
order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7713" href="#xd24e7713" name=
"xd24e7713">334</a>]</span>to engrave on a slab of black marble:
<abbr class="degree" title="">DR.</abbr> DE ESPADA&Ntilde;A, SPECIALIST
IN ALL KINDS OF DISEASES. All the servants had to address them by their
new titles, and as a result she increased the number of frizzes, the
layers of rice-powder, the ribbons and laces, and gazed with more
disdain than ever on her poor and unfortunate countrywomen whose
husbands belonged to a lower grade of society than hers did. Day by day
she felt more dignified and exalted and, by continuing in this way, at
the end of a year she would have believed herself to be of divine
origin.</p>
<p class="par">These sublime thoughts, however, did not keep her from
becoming older and more ridiculous every day. Every time Capitan Tiago
saw her and recalled having made love to her in vain he forthwith sent
a peso to the church for a mass of thanksgiving. Still, he greatly
respected her husband on account of his title of specialist in all
kinds of diseases and listened attentively to the few phrases that he
was able to stutter out. For this reason and because this doctor was
more exclusive than others, Capitan Tiago had selected him to treat his
daughter.</p>
<p class="par">In regard to young Linares, that is another matter. When
arranging for the trip to Spain, Do&ntilde;a Victorina had thought of
having a Peninsular administrator, as she did not trust the Filipinos.
Her husband bethought himself of a nephew of his in Madrid who was
studying law and who was considered the brightest of the family. So
they wrote to him, paying his passage in advance, and when the dream
disappeared he was already on his way.</p>
<p class="par">Such were the three persons who had just arrived. While
they were partaking of a late breakfast, Padre Salvi came in. The
Espada&ntilde;as were already acquainted with him, and they introduced
the blushing young Linares with all his titles.</p>
<p class="par">As was natural, they talked of Maria Clara, who was
resting and sleeping. They talked of their journey, and Do&ntilde;a
Victorina exhibited all her verbosity in criticising the customs of the
provincials,&mdash;their nipa houses, their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7727" href="#xd24e7727" name=
"xd24e7727">335</a>]</span>bamboo bridges; without forgetting to
mention to the curate her intimacy with this and that high official and
other persons of &ldquo;quality&rdquo; who were very fond of her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you had come two days ago, Do&ntilde;a
Victorina,&rdquo; put in Capitan Tiago during a slight pause,
&ldquo;you would have met his Excellency, the Captain-General. He sat
right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What! How&rsquo;s that? His Excellency here! In
your house? No!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I tell you that he sat right there. If you had
only come two days ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, what a pity that Clarita did not get sick
sooner!&rdquo; she exclaimed with real feeling. Then turning to
Linares, &ldquo;Do you hear, cousin? His Excellency was here!
Don&rsquo;t you see now that De Espada&ntilde;a was right when he told
you that you weren&rsquo;t going to the house of a miserable Indian?
Because, you know, Don Santiago, in Madrid our cousin was the friend of
ministers and dukes and dined in the house of Count El
Campanario.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Duke of La Torte, Victorina,&rdquo; corrected
her husband.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7739src" href="#xd24e7739"
name="xd24e7739src">8</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing. If you will tell
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shall I find Padre Damaso in his town?&rdquo;
interrupted Linares, addressing Padre Salvi. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
told that it&rsquo;s near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right here and will be over in a
little while,&rdquo; replied the curate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How glad I am of that! I have a letter to
him,&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, &ldquo;and if it were not for the
happy chance that brings me here, I would have come expressly to visit
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the meantime the <i>happy</i> chance had
awakened.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;De Espada&ntilde;a,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, when the meal was over, &ldquo;shall we go in to see
Clarita?&rdquo; Then to Capitan Tiago, &ldquo;Only for you, Don
Santiago, only for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7764" href=
"#xd24e7764" name="xd24e7764">336</a>]</span>you! My husband only
attends persons of quality, and yet, and yet&mdash;! He&rsquo;s not
like those here. In Madrid he only visited persons of
quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They adjourned to the sick girl&rsquo;s chamber. The
windows were closed from fear of a draught, so the room was almost
dark, being only dimly illuminated by two tapers which burned before an
image of the Virgin of Antipolo. Her head covered with a handkerchief
saturated in cologne, her body wrapped carefully in white sheets which
swathed her youthful form with many folds, under curtains of jusi and
pi&ntilde;a, the girl lay on her kamagon bed. Her hair formed a frame
around her oval countenance and accentuated her transparent paleness,
which was enlivened only by her large, sad eyes. At her side were her
two friends and Andeng with a bouquet of tuberoses.</p>
<p class="par">De Espada&ntilde;a felt her pulse, examined her tongue,
asked a few questions, and said, as he wagged his head from side to
side, &ldquo;S-she&rsquo;s s-sick, but s-she c-can be c-cured.&rdquo;
Do&ntilde;a Victorina looked proudly at the bystanders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Lichen with milk in the morning, syrup of
marshmallow, two cynoglossum pills!&rdquo; ordered De
Espada&ntilde;a.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cheer up, Clarita!&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, going up to her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to cure you. I want
to introduce our cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Linares was so absorbed in the contemplation of those
eloquent eyes, which seemed to be searching for some one, that he did
not hear Do&ntilde;a Victorina name him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Linares,&rdquo; said the curate,
calling him out of his abstraction, &ldquo;here comes Padre
Damaso.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was indeed Padre Damaso, but pale and rather sad. On
leaving his bed his first visit was for Maria Clara. Nor was it the
Padre Damaso of former times, hearty and self-confident; now he moved
silently and with some hesitation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">Without heeding any of the bystanders, Padre
Damaso went directly to the bed of the sick girl and taking her hand
said to her with ineffable tenderness, while tears sprang into his
eyes, &ldquo;Maria, my daughter, you mustn&rsquo;t die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The sick girl opened her eyes and stared at him with a
strange expression. No one who knew the Franciscan had suspected in him
such tender feelings, no one had believed that under his rude and rough
exterior there might beat a heart. Unable to go on, he withdrew from
the girl&rsquo;s side, weeping like a child, and went outside under the
favorite vines of Maria Clara&rsquo;s balcony to give free rein to his
grief.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How he loves his goddaughter!&rdquo; thought all
present, while Fray Salvi gazed at him motionlessly and in silence,
lightly gnawing his lips the while.</p>
<p class="par">When he had become somewhat calm again Do&ntilde;a
Victorina introduced Linares, who approached him respectfully. Fray
Damaso silently looked him over from head to foot, took the letter
offered and read it, but apparently without understanding, for he
asked, &ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Alfonso Linares, the godson of your
brother-in-law,&rdquo; stammered the young man.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Damaso threw back his body and looked the youth
over again carefully. Then his features lighted up and he arose.
&ldquo;So you are the godson of Carlicos!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Come and let me embrace you! I got your letter several days ago.
So it&rsquo;s you! I didn&rsquo;t recognize <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7798" href="#xd24e7798" name=
"xd24e7798">338</a>]</span>you,&mdash;which is easily explained, for
you weren&rsquo;t born when I left the country,&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
recognize you!&rdquo; Padre Damaso squeezed his robust arms about the
young man, who became very red, whether from modesty or lack of breath
is not known.</p>
<p class="par">After the first moments of effusion had passed and
inquiries about Carlicos and his wife had been made and answered, Padre
Damaso asked, &ldquo;Come now, what does Carlicos want me to do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe he says something about that in the
letter,&rdquo; Linares again stammered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the letter? Let&rsquo;s see! That&rsquo;s
right! He wants me to get you a job and a wife. Ahem! A job, a job
that&rsquo;s easy! Can you read and write?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I received my degree of law from the
University.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Carambas!</i> So you&rsquo;re a pettifogger!
You don&rsquo;t show it; you look more like a shy maiden. So much the
better! But to get you a wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre, I&rsquo;m not in such a great
hurry,&rdquo; interrupted Linares in confusion.</p>
<p class="par">But Padre Damaso was already pacing from one end of the
hallway to the other, muttering, &ldquo;A wife, a wife!&rdquo; His
countenance was no longer sad or merry but now wore an expression of
great seriousness, while he seemed to be thinking deeply. Padre Salvi
gazed on the scene from a distance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that the matter would
trouble me so much,&rdquo; murmured Padre Damaso in a tearful voice.
&ldquo;But of two evils, the lesser!&rdquo; Then raising his voice he
approached Linares and said to him, &ldquo;Come, boy, let&rsquo;s talk
to Santiago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Linares turned pale and allowed himself to be dragged
along by the priest, who moved thoughtfully. Then it was Padre
Salvi&rsquo;s turn to pace back and forth, pensive as ever.</p>
<p class="par">A voice wishing him good morning drew him from his
monotonous walk. He raised his head and saw Lucas, who saluted him
humbly.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7825" href=
"#xd24e7825" name="xd24e7825">339</a>]</span>&ldquo;What do you
want?&rdquo; questioned the curate&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre, I&rsquo;m the brother of the man who was
killed on the day of the fiesta,&rdquo; began Lucas in tearful
accents.</p>
<p class="par">The curate recoiled and murmured in a scarcely audible
voice, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lucas made an effort to weep and wiped his eyes with a
handkerchief. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he went on tearfully,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Don Crisostomo to ask for an indemnity. First
he received me with kicks, saying that he wouldn&rsquo;t pay anything
since he himself had run the risk of getting killed through the fault
of my dear, unfortunate brother. I went to talk to him yesterday, but
he had gone to Manila. He left me five hundred pesos for
charity&rsquo;s sake and charged me not to come back again. Ah, Padre,
five hundred pesos for my poor brother&mdash;five hundred pesos! Ah,
Padre&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At first the curate had listened with surprise and
attention while his lips curled slightly with a smile of such disdain
and sarcasm at the sight of this farce that, had Lucas noticed it, he
would have run away at top speed. &ldquo;Now what do you want?&rdquo;
he asked, turning away.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, Padre, tell me for the love of God what I
ought to do. The padre has always given good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who told you so? You don&rsquo;t belong in these
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The padre is known all over the
province.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With irritated looks Padre Salvi approached him and
pointing to the street said to the now startled Lucas, &ldquo;Go home
and be thankful that Don Crisostomo didn&rsquo;t have you sent to jail!
Get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lucas forgot the part he was playing and murmured,
&ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; cried Padre Salvi
nervously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I would like to see Padre Damaso.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre Damaso is busy. Get out of here!&rdquo;
again ordered the curate imperiously.</p>
<p class="par">Lucas went down the stairway muttering,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s another of them&mdash;as he doesn&rsquo;t pay
well&mdash;the one who pays best!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7855" href=
"#xd24e7855" name="xd24e7855">340</a>]</span>At the sound of the
curate&rsquo;s voice all had hurried to the spot, including Padre
Damaso, Capitan Tiago, and Linares.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An insolent vagabond who came to beg and who
doesn&rsquo;t want to work,&rdquo; explained Padre Salvi, picking up
his hat and cane to return to the convento. <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XLIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">An Examination of Conscience</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long days and weary nights passed at the sick
girl&rsquo;s bed. After having confessed herself, Maria Clara had
suffered a relapse, and in her delirium she uttered only the name of
the mother whom she had never known. But her girl friends, her father,
and her aunt kept watch at her side. Offerings and alms were sent to
all the miraculous images, Capitan Tiago vowed a gold cane to the
Virgin of Antipolo, and at length the fever began to subside slowly and
regularly.</p>
<p class="par">Doctor De Espada&ntilde;a was astonished at the virtues
of the syrup of marshmallow and the infusion of lichen, prescriptions
that he had not varied. Do&ntilde;a Victorina was so pleased with her
husband that one day when he stepped on the train of her gown she did
not apply her penal code to the extent of taking his set of false teeth
away from him, but contented herself with merely exclaiming, &ldquo;If
you weren&rsquo;t lame you&rsquo;d even step on my
corset!&rdquo;&mdash;an article of apparel she did not wear.</p>
<p class="par">One afternoon while Sinang and Victoria were visiting
their friend, the curate, Capitan Tiago, and Do&ntilde;a
Victorina&rsquo;s family were conversing over their lunch in the
dining-room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I feel very sorry about it,&rdquo; said the
doctor; &ldquo;Padre Damaso also will regret it very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where do you say they&rsquo;re transferring him
to?&rdquo; Linares asked the curate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the province of Tayabas,&rdquo; replied the
curate negligently.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One who will be greatly affected by it is Maria
Clara, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7880" href="#xd24e7880" name=
"xd24e7880">342</a>]</span>when she learns of it,&rdquo; said Capitan
Tiago. &ldquo;She loves him like a father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Salvi looked at him askance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe, Padre,&rdquo; continued Capitan Tiago,
&ldquo;that all her illness is the result of the trouble on the last
day of the fiesta.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m of the same opinion, and think that
you&rsquo;ve done well not to let Se&ntilde;or Ibarra see her. She
would have got worse.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for us,&rdquo; put in
Do&ntilde;a Victorina, &ldquo;Clarita would already be in heaven
singing praises to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Capitan Tiago thought it his duty to
exclaim. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you that my husband didn&rsquo;t
have any patient of greater quality, for then you&rsquo;d have had to
call in another, and all those here are ignoramuses. My
husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Just as I was saying,&rdquo; the curate in turn
interrupted, &ldquo;I think that the confession that Maria Clara made
brought on the favorable crisis which has saved her life. A clean
conscience is worth more than a lot of medicine. Don&rsquo;t think that
I deny the power of science, above all, that of surgery, but a clean
conscience! Read the pious books and you&rsquo;ll see how many cures
are effected merely by a clean confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; objected the piqued Do&ntilde;a
Victorina, &ldquo;this power of the confessional&mdash;cure the
alferez&rsquo;s woman with a confession!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A wound, madam, is not a form of illness which
the conscience can affect,&rdquo; replied Padre Salvi severely.
&ldquo;Nevertheless, a clean confession will preserve her from
receiving in the future such blows as she got this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She deserves them!&rdquo; went on Do&ntilde;a
Victorina as if she had not heard what Padre Salvi said. &ldquo;That
woman is so insolent! In the church she did nothing but stare at me.
You can see that she&rsquo;s a nobody. Sunday I was going to ask her if
she saw anything funny about my face, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e7901" href="#xd24e7901" name="xd24e7901">343</a>]</span>but who
would lower oneself to speak to people that are not of rank?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The curate, on his part, continued just as though he had
not heard this tirade. &ldquo;Believe me, Don Santiago, to complete
your daughter&rsquo;s recovery it&rsquo;s necessary that she take
communion tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll bring the viaticum over here. I
don&rsquo;t think she has anything to confess, but yet, if she wants to
confess herself tonight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Victorina
instantly took advantage of a slight hesitation on Padre Salvi&rsquo;s
part to add, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how there can be men
capable of marrying such a fright as that woman is. It&rsquo;s easily
seen where she comes from. She&rsquo;s just dying of envy, you can see
it! How much does an alferez get?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Accordingly, Don Santiago, tell your cousin to
prepare the sick girl for the communion tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll come over
tonight to absolve her of her peccadillos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Seeing Aunt Isabel come from the sick-room, he said to
her in Tagalog, &ldquo;Prepare your niece for confession tonight.
Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll bring over the viaticum. With that she&rsquo;ll
improve faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Padre,&rdquo; Linares gathered up enough
courage to ask faintly, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that she&rsquo;s
in any danger of dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; answered the padre
without looking at him. &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m doing; I&rsquo;ve
helped take care of plenty of sick people before. Besides, she&rsquo;ll
decide herself whether or not she wishes to receive the holy communion
and you&rsquo;ll see that she says yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago immediately agreed to everything, while
Aunt Isabel returned to the sick girl&rsquo;s chamber. Maria Clara was
still in bed, pale, very pale, and at her side were her two
friends.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take one more grain,&rdquo; Sinang whispered, as
she offered her a white tablet that she took from a small glass tube.
&ldquo;He says that when you feel a rumbling or buzzing in your ears
you are to stop the medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7921" href=
"#xd24e7921" name="xd24e7921">344</a>]</span>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he
written to you again?&rdquo; asked the sick girl in a low voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, he must be very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he sent any message?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He says nothing more than that he&rsquo;s going
to try to get the Archbishop to absolve him from the excommunication,
so that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This conversation was suspended at the aunt&rsquo;s
approach. &ldquo;The padre says for you to get ready for confession,
daughter,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;You girls must leave her so
that she can make her examination of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it hasn&rsquo;t been a week since she
confessed!&rdquo; protested Sinang. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sick and I
don&rsquo;t sin as often as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ab&aacute;! Don&rsquo;t you know what the curate
says: the righteous sin seven times a day? Come, what book shall I
bring you, the <i>Ancora</i>, the <i>Ramillete</i>, or the <i>Camino
Recto para ir al Cielo?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara did not answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, you mustn&rsquo;t tire yourself,&rdquo;
added the good aunt to console her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read the
examination myself and you&rsquo;ll have only to recall your
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Write to him not to think of me any more,&rdquo;
murmured Maria Clara in Sinang&rsquo;s ear as the latter said good-by
to her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the aunt again approached, and Sinang had to go away
without understanding what her friend had meant. The good old aunt drew
a chair up to the light, put her spectacles on the end of her nose, and
opened a booklet. &ldquo;Pay close attention, daughter. I&rsquo;m going
to begin with the Ten Commandments. I&rsquo;ll go slow so that you can
meditate. If you don&rsquo;t hear well tell me so that I can repeat.
You know that in looking after your welfare I&rsquo;m never
weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She began to read in a monotonous and snuffling voice
the considerations of cases of sinfulness. At the end of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7957" href="#xd24e7957" name=
"xd24e7957">345</a>]</span>each paragraph she made a long pause in
order to give the girl time to recall her sins and to repent of
them.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara stared vaguely into space. After finishing
the first commandment, <i>to love God above all things</i>, Aunt Isabel
looked at her over her spectacles and was satisfied with her sad and
thoughtful mien. She coughed piously and after a long pause began to
read the second commandment. The good old woman read with unction and
when she had finished the commentaries looked again at her niece, who
turned her head slowly to the other side.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Aunt Isabel to herself.
&ldquo;With taking His holy name in vain the poor child has nothing to
do. Let&rsquo;s pass on to the third.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e7966src" href="#xd24e7966" name="xd24e7966src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">The third commandment was analyzed and commented upon.
After citing all the cases in which one can break it she again looked
toward the bed. But now she lifted up her glasses and rubbed her eyes,
for she had seen her niece raise a handkerchief to her face as if to
wipe away tears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hum, ahem! The poor child once went to sleep
during the sermon.&rdquo; Then replacing her glasses on the end of her
nose, she said, &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see if, just as you&rsquo;ve
failed to keep holy the Sabbath, you&rsquo;ve failed to honor your
father and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So she read the fourth commandment in an even slower and
more snuffling voice, thinking thus to give solemnity to the act, just
as she had seen many friars do. Aunt Isabel had never heard a Quaker
preach or she would also have trembled.</p>
<p class="par">The sick girl, in the meantime, raised the handkerchief
to her eyes several times and her breathing became more noticeable.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a good soul!&rdquo; thought the old woman.
&ldquo;She who is so obedient and submissive to every one! I&rsquo;ve
committed more sins and yet I&rsquo;ve never been able really to
cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7981" href=
"#xd24e7981" name="xd24e7981">346</a>]</span>She then began the fifth
commandment with greater pauses and even more pronounced snuffling, if
that were possible, and with such great enthusiasm that she did not
hear the stifled sobs of her niece. Only in a pause which she made
after the comments on homicide, by violence did she notice the groans
of the sinner. Then her tone passed into the sublime as she read the
rest of the commandment in accents that she tried to reader
threatening, seeing that her niece was still weeping.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Weep, daughter, weep!&rdquo; she said,
approaching the bed. &ldquo;The more you weep the sooner God will
pardon you. Hold the sorrow of repentance as better than that of mere
penitence. Weep, daughter, weep! You don&rsquo;t know how much I enjoy
seeing you weep. Beat yourself on the breast also, but not hard, for
you&rsquo;re still sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But, as if her sorrow needed mystery and solitude to
make it increase, Maria Clara, on seeing herself observed, little by
little stopped sighing and dried her eyes without saying anything or
answering her aunt, who continued the reading. Since the wails of her
audience had ceased, however, she lost her enthusiasm, and the last
commandments made her so sleepy that she began to yawn, with great
detriment to her snuffling, which was thus interrupted.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t seen it with my own eyes, I
wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it,&rdquo; thought the good old lady
afterwards. &ldquo;This girl sins like a soldier against the first five
and from the sixth to the tenth not a venial sin, just the opposite to
us! How the world does move now!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So she lighted a large candle to the Virgin of Antipolo
and two other smaller ones to Our Lady of the Rosary and Our Lady of
the Pillar,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e7991src" href="#xd24e7991" name=
"xd24e7991src">2</a> taking care to put away in a corner a marble
crucifix to make it understand that the candles were not lighted for
it. Nor did the Virgin of Delaroche have any share; she was an unknown
foreigner, and Aunt Isabel had never heard of any miracle of hers.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e7995" href=
"#xd24e7995" name="xd24e7995">347</a>]</span>We do not know what
occurred during the confession that night and we respect such secrets.
But the confession was a long one and the aunt, who stood watch over
her niece at a distance, could note that the curate, instead of turning
his ear to hear the words of the sick girl, rather had his face turned
toward hers, and seemed only to be trying to read, or divine, her
thoughts by gazing into her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Pale and with contracted lips Padre Salvi left the
chamber. Looking at his forehead, which was gloomy and covered with
perspiration, one would have said that it was he who had confessed and
had not obtained absolution.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s, Mar&iacute;a, y
Jos&eacute;!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Isabel, crossing herself to
dispel an evil thought, &ldquo;who understands the girls
nowadays?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8004" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XLV</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Hunted</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the dim light shed by the moonbeams sifting
through the thick foliage a man wandered through the forest with slow
and cautious steps. From time to time, as if to find his way, he
whistled a peculiar melody, which was answered in the distance by some
one whistling the same air. The man would listen attentively and then
make his way in the direction of the distant sound, until at length,
after overcoming the thousand obstacles offered by the virgin forest in
the night-time, he reached a small open space, which was bathed in the
light of the moon in its first quarter. The high, tree-crowned rocks
that rose about formed a kind of ruined amphitheater, in the center of
which were scattered recently felled trees and charred logs among
boulders covered with nature&rsquo;s mantle of verdure.</p>
<p class="par">Scarcely had the unknown arrived when another figure
started suddenly from behind a large rock and advanced with drawn
revolver. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked in Tagalog in an
imperious tone, cocking the weapon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is old Pablo among you?&rdquo; inquired the
unknown in an even tone, without answering the question or showing any
signs of fear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean the capitan? Yes, he&rsquo;s
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then tell him that Elias is here looking for
him,&rdquo; was the answer of the unknown, who was no other than the
mysterious pilot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you Elias?&rdquo; asked the other
respectfully, as he approached him, not, however, ceasing to cover him
with the revolver. &ldquo;Then come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias followed him, and they penetrated into a kind of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8025" href="#xd24e8025" name=
"xd24e8025">349</a>]</span>cave sunk down in the depths of the earth.
The guide, who seemed to be familiar with the way, warned the pilot
when he should descend or turn aside or stoop down, so they were not
long in reaching a kind of hall which was poorly lighted by pitch
torches and occupied by twelve to fifteen armed men with dirty faces
and soiled clothing, some seated and some lying down as they talked
fitfully to one another. Resting his arms on a stone that served for a
table and gazing thoughtfully at the torches, which gave out so little
light for so much smoke, was seen an old, sad-featured man with his
head wrapped in a bloody bandage. Did we not know that it was a den of
tulisanes we might have said, on reading the look of desperation in the
old man&rsquo;s face, that it was the Tower of Hunger on the eve before
Ugolino devoured his sons.</p>
<p class="par">Upon the arrival of Elias and his guide the figures
partly rose, but at a signal from the latter they settled back again,
satisfying themselves with the observation that the newcomer was
unarmed. The old man turned his head slowly and saw the quiet figure of
Elias, who stood uncovered, gazing at him with sad interest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you at last,&rdquo; murmured the old
man, his gaze lighting up somewhat as he recognized the youth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In what condition do I find you!&rdquo; exclaimed
the youth in a suppressed tone, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="par">The old man dropped his head in silence and made a sign
to the others, who arose and withdrew, first taking the measure of the
pilot&rsquo;s muscles and stature with a glance.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the old man to Elias as soon as
they were alone. &ldquo;Six months ago when I sheltered you in my
house, it was I who pitied you. Now we have changed parts and it is you
who pity me. But sit down and tell me how you got here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fifteen days now since I was told of
your misfortune,&rdquo; began the young man slowly in a low voice as he
stared at the light. &ldquo;I started at once and have been
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8040" href="#xd24e8040" name=
"xd24e8040">350</a>]</span>seeking you from mountain to mountain.
I&rsquo;ve traveled over nearly the whole of two provinces.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In order not to shed innocent blood,&rdquo;
continued the old man, &ldquo;I have had to flee. My enemies were
afraid to show themselves. I was confronted merely with some
unfortunates who have never done me the least harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After a brief pause during which he seemed to be
occupied in trying to read the thoughts in the dark countenance of the
old man, Elias replied: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to make a proposition to
you. Having sought in vain for some survivor of the family that caused
the misfortunes of mine, I&rsquo;ve decided to leave the province where
I live and move toward the North among the independent pagan tribes.
Don&rsquo;t you want to abandon the life you have entered upon and come
with me? I will be your son, since you have lost your own; I have no
family, and in you will find a father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man shook his, head in negation, saying,
&ldquo;When one at my age makes a desperate resolution, it&rsquo;s
because there is no other recourse. A man who, like myself, has spent
his youth and his mature years toiling for the future of himself and
his sons; a man who has been submissive to every wish of his superiors,
who has conscientiously performed difficult tasks, enduring all that he
might live in peace and quiet&mdash;when that man, whose blood time has
chilled, renounces all his past and foregoes all his future, even on
the very brink of the grave, it is because he has with mature judgment
decided that peace does not exist and that it is not the highest good.
Why drag out miserable days on foreign soil? I had two sons, a
daughter, a home, a fortune, I was esteemed and respected; now I am as
a tree shorn of its branches, a wanderer, a fugitive, hunted like a
wild beast through the forest, and all for what? Because a man
dishonored my daughter, because her brothers called that man&rsquo;s
infamy to account, and because that man is set above his fellows with
the title of minister of God! In spite of everything, I, her father,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8048" href="#xd24e8048" name=
"xd24e8048">351</a>]</span>I, dishonored in my old age, forgave the
injury, for I was indulgent with the passions of youth and the weakness
of the flesh, and in the face of irreparable wrong what could I do but
hold my peace and save what remained to me? But the culprit, fearful of
vengeance sooner or later, sought the destruction of my sons. Do you
know what he did? No? You don&rsquo;t know, then, that he pretended
that there had been a robbery committed in the convento and that one of
my sons figured among the accused? The other could not be included
because he was in another place at the time. Do you know what tortures
they were subjected to? You know of them, for they are the same in all
the towns! I, I saw my son hanging by the hair, I heard his cries, I
heard him call upon me, and I, coward and lover of peace, hadn&rsquo;t
the courage either to kill or to die! Do you know that the theft was
not proved, that it was shown to be a false charge, and that in
punishment the curate was transferred to another town, but that my son
died as a result of his tortures? The other, the one who was left to
me, was not a coward like his father, so our persecutor was still
fearful that he would wreak vengeance on him, and, under the pretext of
his not having his cedula,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8050src" href=
"#xd24e8050" name="xd24e8050src">1</a> which he had not carried with
him just at that time, had him arrested by the Civil Guard, mistreated
him, enraged and harassed him with insults until he was driven to
suicide! And I, I have outlived so much shame; but if I had not the
courage of a father to defend my sons, there yet remains to me a heart
burning for revenge, and I will have it! The discontented are gathering
under my command, my enemies increase my forces, and on the day that I
feel myself strong enough I will descend to the lowlands <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8056" href="#xd24e8056" name=
"xd24e8056">352</a>]</span>and in flames sate my vengeance and end my
own existence. And that day will come or there is no
God!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8058src" href="#xd24e8058" name=
"xd24e8058src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">The old man arose trembling. With fiery look and hollow
voice, he added, tearing his long hair, &ldquo;Curses, curses upon me
that I restrained the avenging hands of my sons&mdash;I have murdered
them! Had I let the guilty perish, had I confided less in the justice
of God and men, I should now have my sons&mdash;fugitives, perhaps, but
I should have them; they would not have died under torture! I was not
born to be a father, so I have them not! Curses upon me that I had not
learned with my years to know the conditions under which I lived! But
in fire and blood by my own death I will avenge them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In his paroxysm of grief the unfortunate father tore
away the bandage, reopening a wound in his forehead from which gushed a
stream of blood.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I respect your sorrow,&rdquo; said Elias,
&ldquo;and I understand your desire for revenge. I, too, am like you,
and yet from fear of injuring the innocent I prefer to forget my
misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You can forget because you are young and because
you haven&rsquo;t lost a son, your last hope! But I assure you that I
shall injure no innocent one. Do you see this wound? Rather than kill a
poor cuadrillero, who was doing his duty, I let him inflict
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But look,&rdquo; urged Elias, after a
moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;look what a frightful catastrophe you
are going to bring down upon our unfortunate people. If you accomplish
your revenge by your own hand, your enemies will make terrible
reprisals, not against you, not against those who are armed, but
against the peaceful, who as usual will be accused&mdash;and then the
eases of injustice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let the people learn to defend themselves, let
each one defend himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8078" href=
"#xd24e8078" name="xd24e8078">353</a>]</span>&ldquo;You know that that
is impossible. Sir, I knew you in other days when you were happy; then
you gave me good advice, will you now permit me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man folded his arms in an attitude of attention.
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; continued Elias, weighing his words well, &ldquo;I
have had the good fortune to render a service to a young man who is
rich, generous, noble, and who desires the welfare of his country. They
say that this young man has friends in Madrid&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
myself&mdash;but I can assure you that he is a friend of the
Captain-General&rsquo;s. What do you say that we make him the bearer of
the people&rsquo;s complaints, if we interest him in the cause of the
unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man shook his head. &ldquo;You say that he is
rich? The rich think only of increasing their wealth, pride and show
blind them, and as they are generally safe, above all when they have
powerful friends, none of them troubles himself about the woes of the
unfortunate. I know all, because I was rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the man of whom I speak is not like the
others. He is a son who has been insulted over the memory of his
father, and a young man who, as he is soon to have a family, thinks of
the future, of a happy future for his children.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then he is a man who is going to be
happy&mdash;our cause is not for happy men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it is for men who have feelings!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; replied the old man, seating
himself. &ldquo;Suppose that he agrees to carry our cry even to the
Captain-General, suppose that he finds in the Cortes<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e8092src" href="#xd24e8092" name="xd24e8092src">3</a> delegates
who will plead for us; do you think that we shall get
justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let us try it before we resort to violent
measure,&rdquo; answered Elias. &ldquo;You must be surprised that I,
another unfortunate, young and strong, should propose to you, old and
weak, peaceful measures, but it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve seen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8097" href="#xd24e8097" name=
"xd24e8097">354</a>]</span>as much misery caused by us as by the
tyrants. The defenseless are the ones who pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And if we accomplish nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Something we shall accomplish, believe me, for
all those who are in power are not unjust. But if we accomplish
nothing, if they disregard our entreaties, if man has become deaf to
the cry of sorrow from his kind, then I will put myself under your
orders!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man embraced the youth enthusiastically.
&ldquo;I accept your proposition, Elias. I know that you will keep your
word. You will come to me, and I shall help you to revenge your
ancestors, you will help me to revenge my sons, my sons that were like
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the meantime, sir, you will refrain from
violent measures?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will present the complaints of the people,
you know them. When shall I know your answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In four days send a man to the beach at San Diego
and I will tell him what I shall have learned from the person in whom I
place so much hope. If he accepts, they will give us justice; and if
not, I&rsquo;ll be the first to fall in the struggle that we will
begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Elias will not die, Elias will be the leader when
Capitan Pablo fails, satisfied in his revenge,&rdquo; concluded the old
man, as he accompanied the youth out of the cave into the open air.

<h2 class="label">Chapter XLVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Cockpit</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">To keep holy the afternoon of the Sabbath one
generally goes to the cockpit in the Philippines, just as to the
bull-fights in Spain. Cockfighting, a passion introduced into the
country and exploited for a century past, is one of the vices of the
people, more widely spread than opium-smoking among the Chinese. There
the poor man goes to risk all that he has, desirous of getting rich
without work. There the rich man goes to amuse himself, using the money
that remains to him from his feasts and his masses of thanksgiving. The
fortune that he gambles is his own, the cock is raised with much more
care perhaps than his son and successor in the cockpit, so we have
nothing to say against it. Since the government permits it and even in
a way recommends it, by providing that the spectacle may take place
only in the <i>public plazas</i>, on <i>holidays</i> (in order that all
may see it and be encouraged by the example?), <i>from the high mass
until nightfall (eight</i> hours), let us proceed thither to seek out
some of our acquaintances.</p>
<p class="par">The cockpit of San Diego does not differ from those to
be found in other towns, except in some details. It consists of three
parts, the first of which, the entrance, is a large rectangle some
twenty meters long by fourteen wide. On one side is the gateway,
generally tended by an old woman whose business it is to collect the
<i>sa pintu</i>, or admission fee. Of this contribution, which every
one pays, the government receives a part, amounting to some hundreds of
thousands of pesos a year. It is said that with this money, with which
vice pays its license, magnificent <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e8136" href="#xd24e8136" name=
"xd24e8136">356</a>]</span>schoolhouses are erected, bridges and roads
are constructed, prizes for encouraging agriculture and commerce are
distributed: blessed be the vice that produces such good results! In
this first enclosure are the vendors of buyos, cigars, sweetmeats, and
foodstuffs. There swarm the boys in company with their fathers or
uncles, who carefully initiate them into the secrets of life.</p>
<p class="par">This enclosure communicates with another of somewhat
larger dimensions,&mdash;a kind of foyer where the public gathers while
waiting for the combats. There are the greater part of the
fighting-cocks tied with cords which are fastened to the ground by
means of a piece of bone or hard wood; there are assembled the
gamblers, the devotees, those skilled in tying on the gaffs, there they
make agreements, they deliberate, they beg for loans, they curse, they
swear, they laugh boisterously. That one fondles his chicken, rubbing
his hand over its brilliant plumage, this one examines and counts the
scales on its legs, they recount the exploits of the champions.</p>
<p class="par">There you will see many with mournful faces carrying by
the feet corpses picked of their feathers; the creature that was the
favorite for months, petted and cared for day and night, on which were
founded such flattering hopes, is now nothing more than a carcass to be
sold for a peseta or to be stewed with ginger and eaten that very
night. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi!</i> The loser returns to the home
where his anxious wife and ragged children await him, without his money
or his chicken. Of all that golden dream, of all those vigils during
months from the dawn of day to the setting of the sun, of all those
fatigues and labors, there results only a peseta, the ashes left from
so much smoke.</p>
<p class="par">In this foyer even the least intelligent takes part in
the discussion, while the man of most hasty judgment conscientiously
investigates the matter, weighs, examines, extends the wings, feels the
muscles of the cocks. Some go very well-dressed, surrounded and
followed by the partisans <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8147"
href="#xd24e8147" name="xd24e8147">357</a>]</span>of their champions;
others who are dirty and bear the imprint of vice on their squalid
features anxiously follow the movements of the rich to note the bets,
since the purse may become empty but the passion never satiated. No
countenance here but is animated&mdash;not here is to be found the
indolent, apathetic, silent Filipino&mdash;all is movement, passion,
eagerness. It may be, one would say, that they have that thirst which
is quickened by the water of the swamp.</p>
<p class="par">From this place one passes into the arena, which is
known as the <i>Rueda</i>, the wheel. The ground here, surrounded by
bamboo-stakes, is usually higher than that in the two other divisions.
In the back part, reaching almost to the roof, are tiers of seats for
the spectators, or gamblers, since these are the same. During the
fights these seats are filled with men and boys who shout, clamor,
sweat, quarrel, and blaspheme&mdash;fortunately, hardly any women get
in this far. In the <i>Rueda</i> are the men of importance, the rich,
the famous bettors, the contractor, the referee. On the perfectly
leveled ground the cocks fight, and from there Destiny apportions to
the families smiles or tears, feast or famine.</p>
<p class="par">At the time of entering we see the gobernadorcillo,
Capitan Pablo, Capitan Basilio, and Lucas, the man with the sear on his
face who felt so deeply the death of his brother.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Basilio approaches one of the townsmen and asks,
&ldquo;Do you know which cock Capitan Tiago is going to
bring?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. This morning two came,
one of them the <i>l&aacute;sak</i> that whipped the Consul&rsquo;s
<i>talisain</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8169src" href=
"#xd24e8169" name="xd24e8169src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think that my <i>bulik</i> is a match for
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should say so! I&rsquo;ll bet my house and my
camisa on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that moment Capitan Tiago arrives, dressed like the
heavy gamblers, in a camisa of Canton linen, woolen pantaloons,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8187" href="#xd24e8187" name=
"xd24e8187">358</a>]</span>and a wide straw hat. Behind him come two
servants carrying the <i>l&aacute;sak</i> and a white cock of enormous
size.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sinang tells me that Maria is improving all the
time,&rdquo; says Capitan Basilio.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She has no more fever but is still very
weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you lose last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A little. I hear that you won. I&rsquo;m going to
see if I can&rsquo;t get even here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you want to fight the
<i>l&aacute;sak?</i>&rdquo; asks Capitan Basilio, looking at the cock
and taking it from the servant. &ldquo;That depends&mdash;if
there&rsquo;s a bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How much will you put up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t gamble for less than
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you seen my <i>bulik?</i>&rdquo; inquires
Capitan Basilio, calling to a man who is carrying a small
game-cock.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago examines it and after feeling its weight
and studying its scales returns it with the question, &ldquo;How much
will you put up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whatever you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Two, and five hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Three?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Three!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For the next fight after this!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The chorus of curious bystanders and the gamblers spread
the news that two celebrated cocks will fight, each of which has a
history and a well-earned reputation. All wish to see and examine the
two celebrities, opinions are offered, prophecies are made.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, the murmur of the voices grows, the confusion
increases, the <i>Rueda</i> is broken into, the seats are filled. The
skilled attendants carry the two cocks into the arena, a white and a
red, already armed but with the gaffs still sheathed. Cries are heard,
&ldquo;On the white!&rdquo; &ldquo;On the white!&rdquo; while some
other voice answers, &ldquo;On the red!&rdquo; The odds are on the
white, he is the favorite; the red is the &ldquo;outsider,&rdquo; the
<i>dejado</i>.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8238" href=
"#xd24e8238" name="xd24e8238">359</a>]</span>Members of the Civil Guard
move about in the crowd. They are not dressed in the uniform of that
meritorious corps, but neither are they in civilian costume. Trousers
of <i>guing&oacute;n</i> with a red stripe, a camisa stained blue from
the faded blouse, and a service-cap, make up their costume, in keeping
with their deportment; they make bets and keep watch, they raise
disturbances and talk of keeping the peace.</p>
<p class="par">While the spectators are yelling, waving their hands,
flourishing and clinking pieces of silver; while they search in their
pockets for the last coin, or, in the lack of such, try to pledge their
word, promising to sell the carabao or the next crop, two boys,
brothers apparently, follow the bettors with wistful eyes, loiter
about, murmur timid words to which no one listens, become more and more
gloomy and gaze at one another ill-humoredly and dejectedly. Lucas
watches them covertly, smiles malignantly, jingles his silver, passes
close to them, and gazing into the <i>Rueda</i>, cries out:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fifty, fifty to twenty on the white!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The two brothers exchange glances.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; muttered the elder,
&ldquo;that you shouldn&rsquo;t have put up all the money. If you had
listened to me we should now have something to bet on the
red.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The younger timidly approached Lucas and touched him on
the arm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; exclaimed the latter,
turning around with feigned surprise. &ldquo;Does your brother accept
my proposition or do you want to bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How can we bet when we&rsquo;ve lost
everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then you accept?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to! If you would lend us
something, now that you say you know us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lucas scratched his head, pulled at his camisa, and
replied, &ldquo;Yes, I know you. You are Tarsilo and Bruno, both young
and strong. I know that your brave father died as a result of the
hundred lashes a day those soldiers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e8267" href="#xd24e8267" name="xd24e8267">360</a>]</span>gave him.
I know that you don&rsquo;t think of revenging him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t meddle in our affairs!&rdquo; broke
in Tarsilo, the elder. &ldquo;That might lead to trouble. If it were
not that we have a sister, we should have been hanged long
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hanged? They only hang a coward, one who has no
money or influence. And at all events the mountains are
near.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A hundred to twenty on the white!&rdquo; cried a
passer-by.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Lend us four pesos, three, two,&rdquo; begged the
younger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon pay them back double. The fight
is going to commence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lucas again scratched his head. &ldquo;Tush! This money
isn&rsquo;t mine. Don Crisostomo has given it to me for those who are
willing to serve him. But I see that you&rsquo;re not like your
father&mdash;he was really brave&mdash;let him who is not so not seek
amusement!&rdquo; So saying, he drew away from them a little.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take him up, what&rsquo;s the
difference?&rdquo; said Bruno. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same to be shot as
to be hanged. We poor folks are good for nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;but think of our
sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, the ring has been cleared and the combat is
about to begin. The voices die away as the two starters, with the
expert who fastens the gaffs, are left alone in the center. At a signal
from the referee, the expert unsheathes the gaffs and the fine blades
glitter threateningly.</p>
<p class="par">Sadly and silently the two brothers draw nearer to the
ring until their foreheads are pressed against the railing. A man
approaches them and calls into their ears, &ldquo;<i>Pare</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8293src" href="#xd24e8293" name="xd24e8293src">2</a>
a hundred to ten on the white!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo stares at him in a foolish way and responds to
Bruno&rsquo;s nudge with a grunt.</p>
<p class="par">The starters hold the cocks with skilful delicacy,
taking care not to wound themselves. A solemn silence reigns;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8303" href="#xd24e8303" name=
"xd24e8303">361</a>]</span>the spectators seem to be changed into
hideous wax figures. They present one cock to the other, holding his
head down so that the other may peck at it and thus irritate him. Then
the other is given a like opportunity, for in every duel there must be
fair play, whether it is a question of Parisian cocks or Filipino
cocks. Afterwards, they hold them up in sight of each other, close
together, so that each of the enraged little creatures may see who it
is that has pulled out a feather, and with whom he must fight. Their
neck-feathers bristle up as they gaze at each other fixedly with
flashes of anger darting from their little round eyes. Now the moment
has come; the attendants place them on the ground a short distance
apart and leave them a clear field.</p>
<p class="par">Slowly they advance, their footfalls are, audible on the
hard ground. No one in the crowd speaks, no one breathes. Raising and
lowering their heads as if to gauge one another with a look, the two
cocks utter sounds of defiance and contempt. Each sees the bright blade
throwing out its cold, bluish reflections. The danger animates them and
they rush directly toward each other, but a pace apart they check
themselves with fixed gaze and bristling plumage. At that moment their
little heads are filled with a rush of blood, their anger flashes
forth, and they hurl themselves together with instinctive valor. They
strike beak to beak, breast to breast, gaff to gaff, wing to wing, but
the blows are skilfully parried, only a few feathers fall. Again they
size each other up: suddenly the white rises on his wings, brandishing
the deadly knife, but the red has bent his legs and lowered his head,
so the white smites only the empty air.. Then on touching the ground
the white, fearing a blow from behind, turns quickly to face his
adversary. The red attacks him furiously, but he defends himself
calmly&mdash;not undeservedly is he the favorite of the spectators, all
of whom tremulously and anxiously follow the fortunes of the fight,
only here and there an involuntary cry being heard.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8308" href=
"#xd24e8308" name="xd24e8308">362</a>]</span>The ground becomes strewn
with red and white feathers dyed in blood, but the contest is not for
the first blood; the Filipino, carrying out the laws dictated by his
government, wishes it to be to the death or until one or the other
turns tail and runs. Blood covers the ground, the blows are more
numerous, but victory still hangs in the balance. At last, with a
supreme effort, the white throws himself forward for a final stroke,
fastens his gaff in the wing of the red and catches it between the
bones. But the white himself has been wounded in the breast and both
are weak and feeble from loss of blood. Breathless, their strength
spent, caught one against the other, they remain motionless until the
white, with blood pouring from his beak, falls, kicking his
death-throes. The red remains at his side with his wing caught, then
slowly doubles up his legs and gently closes his eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Then the referee, in accordance with the rule prescribed
by the government, declares the red the winner. A savage yell greets
the decision, a yell that is heard over the whole town, even and
prolonged. He who hears this from afar then knows that the winner is
the one against which the odds were placed, or the joy would not be so
lasting. The same happens with the nations: when a small one gains a
victory over a large one, it is sung and recounted from age to age.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see now!&rdquo; said Bruno dejectedly to his
brother, &ldquo;if you had listened to me we should now have a hundred
pesos. You&rsquo;re the cause of our being penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo did not answer, but gazed about him as if
looking for some one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There he is, talking to Pedro,&rdquo; added
Bruno. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s giving him money, lots of money!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">True it was that Lucas was counting silver coins into
the hand of Sisa&rsquo;s husband. The two then exchanged some words in
secret and separated, apparently satisfied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pedro must have agreed. That&rsquo;s what it is
to be decided,&rdquo; sighed Bruno.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8324" href=
"#xd24e8324" name="xd24e8324">363</a>]</span>Tarsilo remained gloomy
and thoughtful, wiping away with the cuff of his camisa the
perspiration that ran down his forehead.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Bruno, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to accept, if you don&rsquo;t decide. The <i>law</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8330src" href="#xd24e8330" name="xd24e8330src">3</a>
continues, the <i>l&aacute;sak</i> must win and we ought not to lose
any chance. I want to bet on the next fight. What&rsquo;s the
difference? We&rsquo;ll revenge our father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Tarsilo, as he gazed at him
fixedly, eye to eye, while both turned pale. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with
you, you&rsquo;re right. We&rsquo;ll revenge our father.&rdquo; Still,
he hesitated, and again wiped away the perspiration.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s stopping you?&rdquo; asked Bruno
impatiently.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know what fight comes next? Is it worth
while?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you think that way, no! Haven&rsquo;t you
heard? The <i>bulik</i> of Capitan Basilio&rsquo;s against Capitan
Tiago&rsquo;s <i>l&aacute;sak</i>. According to the <i>law</i> the
<i>l&aacute;sak</i> must win.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, the <i>l&aacute;sak</i>! I&rsquo;d bet on it,
too. But let&rsquo;s be sure first.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Bruno made a sign of impatience, but followed his
brother, who examined the cock, studied it, meditated and reflected,
asked some questions. The poor fellow was in doubt. Bruno gazed at him
with nervous anger.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see that wide scale he has by
the side of his spur? Don&rsquo;t you see those feet? What more do you
want? Look at those legs, spread out his wings! And this split scale
above this wide one, and this double one?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo did not hear him, but went on examining the
cock. The clinking of gold and silver came to his ears. &ldquo;Now
let&rsquo;s look at the <i>bulik</i>,&rdquo; he said in a thick
voice.</p>
<p class="par">Bruno stamped on the ground and gnashed his teeth, but
obeyed. They approached another group where a cock was being prepared
for the ring. A gaff was selected, red <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e8376" href="#xd24e8376" name="xd24e8376">364</a>]</span>silk
thread for tying it on was waxed and rubbed thoroughly. Tarsilo took in
the creature with a gloomily impressive gaze, as if he were not looking
at the bird so much as at something in the future. He rubbed his hand
across his forehead and said to his brother in a stifled voice,
&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I? Long ago! Without looking at them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, our poor sister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;!</i> Haven&rsquo;t they told you
that Don Crisostomo is the leader? Didn&rsquo;t you see him walking
with the Captain-General? What risk do we run?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And if we get killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? Our father was
flogged to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The brothers now sought for Lucas in the different
groups. As soon as they saw him Tarsilo stopped. &ldquo;No! Let&rsquo;s
get out of here! We&rsquo;re going to ruin ourselves!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go on if you want to! I&rsquo;m going to
accept!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bruno!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Unfortunately, a man approached them, saying, &ldquo;Are
you betting? I&rsquo;m for the <i>bulik!</i>&rdquo; The brothers did
not answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give odds!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked Bruno.</p>
<p class="par">The man began to count out his pesos. Bruno watched him
breathlessly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have two hundred. Fifty to forty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bruno resolutely.
&ldquo;Put&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All right! Fifty to thirty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Double it if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All right. The <i>bulik</i> belongs to my
protector and I&rsquo;ve just won. A hundred to sixty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Taken! Wait till I get the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll hold the stakes,&rdquo; said the
other, not confiding much in Bruno&rsquo;s looks.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8430" href=
"#xd24e8430" name="xd24e8430">365</a>]</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the
same to me,&rdquo; answered the latter, trusting to his fists. Then
turning to his brother he added, &ldquo;Even if you do keep out,
I&rsquo;m going in.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo reflected: he loved his brother and liked the
sport, and, unable to desert him, he murmured, &ldquo;Let it
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They made their way to Lucas, who, on seeing them
approach, smiled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; called Tarsilo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How much will you give us?&rdquo; asked the two
brothers together.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you. If you will
undertake to get others for the purpose of making a surprise-attack on
the barracks, I&rsquo;ll give each of you thirty pesos and ten pesos
for each companion you bring. If all goes well, each one will receive a
hundred pesos and you double that amount. Don Crisostomo is
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Accepted!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruno.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I knew you were brave, as your father was! Come,
so that those fellows who killed him may not overhear us,&rdquo; said
Lucas, indicating the civil-guards.</p>
<p class="par">Taking them into a corner, he explained to them while he
was counting out the money, &ldquo;Tomorrow Don Crisostomo will get
back with the arms. Day after tomorrow, about eight o&rsquo;clock at
night, go to the cemetery and I&rsquo;ll let you know the final
arrangements. You have time to look for companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After they had left him the two brothers seemed to have
changed parts&mdash;Tarsilo was calm, while Bruno was uneasy.

<h2 class="main">The Two Se&ntilde;oras</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">While Capitan Tiago was gambling on his
<i>l&aacute;sak</i>, Do&ntilde;a Victorina was taking a walk through
the town for the purpose of observing how the indolent Indians kept
their houses and fields. She was dressed as elegantly as possible with
all her ribbons and flowers over her silk gown, in order to impress the
provincials and make them realize what a distance intervened between
them and her sacred person. Giving her arm to her lame husband, she
strutted along the streets amid the wonder and stupefaction of the
natives. Her cousin Linares had remained in the house.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What ugly shacks these Indians have!&rdquo; she
began with a grimace. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they can live in
them&mdash;one must have to be an Indian! And how rude they are and how
proud! They don&rsquo;t take off their hats when they meet us! Hit them
over the head as the curates and the officers of the Civil Guard
do&mdash;teach them politeness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And if they hit me back?&rdquo; asked Dr. De
Espada&ntilde;a.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re a man
for!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;B-but, I&rsquo;m l-lame!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Do&ntilde;a Victorina was falling into a bad humor. The
streets were unpaved and the train of her gown was covered with dust.
Besides, they had met a number of young women, who, in passing them,
had dropped their eyes and had not admired her rich costume as they
should have done. Sinang&rsquo;s cochero, who was driving Sinang and
her cousin in an elegant carriage, had the impudence to yell
&ldquo;<i>Tabi!</i>&rdquo; in such a commanding tone that she had to
jump out of the way, and could only protest: &ldquo;Look at that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8477" href="#xd24e8477" name=
"xd24e8477">367</a>]</span>brute of a cochero! I&rsquo;m going to tell
his master to train his servants better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the house,&rdquo; she
commanded to her husband, who, fearing a storm, wheeled on his crutch
in obedience to her mandate.</p>
<p class="par">They met and exchanged greetings with the alferez. This
increased Do&ntilde;a Victorina&rsquo;s ill humor, for the officer not
only did not proffer any compliment on her costume, but even seemed to
stare at it in a mocking way.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You ought not to shake hands with a mere
alferez,&rdquo; she said to her husband as the soldier left them.
&ldquo;He scarcely touched his helmet while you took off your hat. You
don&rsquo;t know how to maintain your rank!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the b-boss here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do we care for that? We are Indians,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he assented, not
caring to quarrel. They passed in front of the officer&rsquo;s
dwelling. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion was at the window, as usual, dressed
in flannel and smoking her cigar. As the house was low, the two
se&ntilde;oras measured one another with looks; Do&ntilde;a Victorina
stared while the Muse of the Civil Guard examined her from head to
foot, and then, sticking out her lower lip, turned her head away and
spat on the ground. This used up the last of Do&ntilde;a
Victorina&rsquo;s patience. Leaving her husband without support, she
planted herself in front of the alfereza, trembling with anger from
head to foot and unable to speak. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion slowly turned
her head, calmly looked her over again, and once more spat, this time
with greater disdain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you,
Do&ntilde;a?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can you tell me, se&ntilde;ora, why you look at
me so? Are you envious?&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Victorina was at length able
to articulate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I, envious of you, I, of you?&rdquo; drawled the
Muse. &ldquo;Yes, I envy you those frizzes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, woman!&rdquo; pleaded the doctor.
&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t t-take any n-notice!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8501" href=
"#xd24e8501" name="xd24e8501">368</a>]</span>&ldquo;Let me teach this
shameless slattern a lesson,&rdquo; replied his wife, giving him such a
shove that he nearly kissed the ground. Then she again turned to
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Remember who you&rsquo;re dealing with!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m a provincial or
a soldier&rsquo;s <i>querida!</i> In my house in Manila the alfereces
don&rsquo;t eater, they wait at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oho, <i>Excelent&iacute;sima Se&ntilde;ora!</i>
Alfereces don&rsquo;t enter, but cripples do&mdash;like that
one&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Had it not been for the rouge, Do&ntilde;a Victorian
would have been seen to blush. She tried to get to her antagonist, but
the sentinel stopped her. In the meantime the street was filling up
with a curious crowd.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen, I lower myself talking to
you&mdash;people of quality&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you want to wash my
clothes? I&rsquo;ll pay you well! Do you think that I don&rsquo;t know
that you were a washerwoman<i>?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Do&ntilde;a Consolacion straightened up furiously; the
remark about washing hurt her. &ldquo;Do you think that we don&rsquo;t
know who you are and what class of people you belong with? Get out, my
husband has already told me! Se&ntilde;ora, I at least have never
belonged to more than one, but you? One must be dying of hunger to take
the leavings, the mop of the whole world!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This shot found its mark with Do&ntilde;a Victorina. She
rolled up her sleeves, clenched her fists, and gritted her teeth.
&ldquo;Come down, old sow!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
smash that dirty mouth of yours! <i>Querida</i> of a battalion, filthy
hag!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Muse immediately disappeared from the window and was
soon seen running down the stairs flourishing her husband&rsquo;s
whip.</p>
<p class="par">Don Tiburcio interposed himself supplicatingly, but they
would have come to blows had not the alferez arrived on the scene.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ladies! Don Tiburcio!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Train your woman better, buy her some decent
clothes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8536" href="#xd24e8536"
name="xd24e8536">369</a>]</span>and if you haven&rsquo;t any money
left, rob the people&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got soldiers
for!&rdquo; yelled Do&ntilde;a Victorina.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here I am, se&ntilde;ora! Why doesn&rsquo;t your
Excellency smash my mouth? You&rsquo;re only tongue and spittle,
Do&ntilde;a Excelencia!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora!&rdquo; cried the alferez furiously
to Do&ntilde;a Victorina, &ldquo;be thankful that I remember that
you&rsquo;re a woman or else I&rsquo;d kick you to
pieces&mdash;frizzes, ribbons, and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;S-se&ntilde;or Alferez!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Get out, you quack! You don&rsquo;t wear the
pants!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The women brought into play words and gestures, insults
and abuse, dragging out all the evil that was stored in the recesses of
their minds. Since all four talked at once and said so many things that
might hurt the prestige of certain classes by the truths that were
brought to light, we forbear from recording what they said. The curious
spectators, while they may not have understood all that was said, got
not a little entertainment out of the scene and hoped that the affair
would come to blows. Unfortunately for them, the curate came along and
restored order.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores! Se&ntilde;oras! What a shame!
Se&ntilde;or Alferez!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you doing here, you hypocrite,
Carlist!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Tiburcio, take your wife away! Se&ntilde;ora,
hold your tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Say that to these robbers of the poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Little by little the lexicon of epithets was exhausted,
the review of shamelessness of the two couples completed, and with
threats and insults they gradually drew away from one another. Fray
Salvi moved from one group to the other, giving animation to the scene.
Would that our friend the correspondent had been present!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This very day we&rsquo;ll go to Manila and see
the Captain-General!&rdquo; declared the raging Do&ntilde;a Victorina
to her husband. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a man! It&rsquo;s a waste of
money to buy trousers for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;B-but, woman, the g-guards? I&rsquo;m
l-lame!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8564" href=
"#xd24e8564" name="xd24e8564">370</a>]</span>&ldquo;You must challenge
him for pistol or sword, or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a
Victorina stared fixedly at his false teeth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My d-dear, I&rsquo;ve never had hold of
a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But she did not let him finish. With a majestic sweep of
her hand she snatched out his false teeth and trampled them in the
street.</p>
<p class="par">Thus, he half-crying and she breathing fire, they
reached the house. Linares was talking with Maria Clara, Sinang, and
Victoria, and as he had heard nothing of the quarrel, became rather
uneasy at sight of his cousins. Maria Clara, lying in an easy-chair
among pillows and wraps, was greatly surprised to see the new
physiognomy of her doctor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; began Do&ntilde;a Victorina,
&ldquo;you must challenge the alferez right away, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the startled Linares.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You challenge him right now or else I&rsquo;ll
tell everybody here who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Do&ntilde;a Victorina!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The three girls exchanged glances.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see! The alferez has insulted us and
said that you are what you are! His old hag came down with a whip and
he, this thing here, permitted the insult&mdash;a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Sinang,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re had a fight and we didn&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alferez smashed the doctor&rsquo;s
teeth,&rdquo; observed Victoria.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This very day we go to Manila. You, you stay here
to challenge him or else I&rsquo;ll tell Don Santiago that all
we&rsquo;re told him is a lie, I&rsquo;ll tell him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, Do&ntilde;a
Victorina,&rdquo; interrupted the now pallid Linares, going up to her,
&ldquo;be calm, don&rsquo;t call up&mdash;&rdquo; Then he added in a
whisper, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be imprudent, especially just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that moment Capitan Tiago came in from the cockpit,
sad and sighing; he had lost his <i>l&aacute;sak</i>. But Do&ntilde;a
Victorina left him no time to grieve. In a few words but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8602" href="#xd24e8602" name=
"xd24e8602">371</a>]</span>with no lack of strong language she related
what had happened, trying of course to put herself in the best light
possible.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Linares is going to challenge him, do you hear?
If he doesn&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t let him marry your daughter,
don&rsquo;t you permit it! If he hasn&rsquo;t any courage, he
doesn&rsquo;t deserve Clarita!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to marry this
gentleman?&rdquo; asked Sinang, but her merry eyes filled with tears.
&ldquo;I knew that you were prudent but not that you were
fickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Pale as wax, Maria Clara partly rose and stared with
frightened eyes at her father, at Do&ntilde;a Victorina, at Linares.
The latter blushed, Capitan Tiago dropped his eyes, while the
se&ntilde;ora went on:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Clarita, bear this in mind: never marry a man
that doesn&rsquo;t wear trousers. You expose yourself to insults, even
from the dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl did not answer her, but turned to her friends
and said, &ldquo;Help me to my room, I can&rsquo;t walk
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">By their aid she rose, and with her waist encircled by
the round arms of her friends, resting her marble-like head on the
shoulder of the beautiful Victoria, she went to her chamber.</p>
<p class="par">That same night the married couple gathered their
effects together and presented Capitan Tiago with a bill which amounted
to several thousand pesos. Very early the following day they left for
Manila in his carriage, committing to the bashful Linares the office of
avenger. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8618" href="#xd24e8618"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As Lucas had foretold, Ibarra arrived on the
following day. His first visit was to the family of Capitan Tiago for
the purpose of seeing Maria Clara and informing her that his Grace had
reconciled him with religion, and that he brought to the curate a
letter of recommendation in the handwriting of the Archbishop himself.
Aunt Isabel was not a little rejoiced at this, for she liked the young
man and did not look favorably on the marriage of her niece with
Linares. Capitan Tiago was not at home.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the aunt in her broken
Spanish. &ldquo;Maria, Don Crisostomo is once more in the favor of God.
The Archbishop has <i>discommunicated</i> him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the youth was unable to advance, the smile froze on
his lips, words failed him. Standing on the balcony at the side of
Maria Clara was Linares, arranging bouquets of flowers and leaves.
Roses and sampaguitas were scattered about on the floor. Reclining in a
big chair, pale, with a sad and pensive air, Maria Clara toyed with an
ivory fan which was not whiter than her shapely fingers.</p>
<p class="par">At the appearance of Ibarra, Linares turned pale and
Maria Clara&rsquo;s cheeks flushed crimson. She tried to rise, but
strength failed her, so she dropped her eyes and let the fan fall. An
embarrassed silence prevailed for a few moments. Ibarra was then able
to move forward and murmur tremblingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got back
and have come immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8643"
href="#xd24e8643" name="xd24e8643">373</a>]</span>to see you. I find
you better than I had thought I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl seemed to have been stricken dumb; she neither
said anything nor raised her eyes.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra looked Linares over from head to foot with a
stare which the bashful youth bore haughtily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, I see that my arrival was
unexpected,&rdquo; said Ibarra slowly. &ldquo;Maria, pardon me that I
didn&rsquo;t have myself announced. At some other time I&rsquo;ll be
able to make explanations to you about my conduct. We&rsquo;ll still
see one another surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These last words were accompanied by a look at Linares.
The girl raised toward him her lovely eyes, full of purity and sadness.
They were so beseeching and eloquent that Ibarra stopped in
confusion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May I come tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know that for my part you are always
welcome,&rdquo; she answered faintly.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra withdrew in apparent calm, but with a tempest in
his head and ice in his heart. What he had just seen and felt was
incomprehensible to him: was it doubt, dislike, or faithlessness?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, only a woman after all!&rdquo; he
murmured.</p>
<p class="par">Taking no note of where he was going, he reached the
spot where the schoolhouse was under construction. The work was well
advanced, &Ntilde;or Juan with his mile and plumb-bob coming and going
among the numerous laborers. Upon catching sight of Ibarra he ran to
meet him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Crisostomo, at last you&rsquo;ve come!
We&rsquo;ve all been waiting for you. Look at the walls, they&rsquo;re
already more than a meter high and within two days they&rsquo;ll be up
to the height of a man. I&rsquo;ve put in only the strongest and most
durable woods&mdash;molave, dungon, ipil, langil&mdash;and sent for the
finest&mdash;tindalo, malatapay, pino, and narra&mdash;for the
finishings. Do you want to look at the foundations?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The workmen saluted Ibarra respectfully, while
&Ntilde;or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8668" href="#xd24e8668"
name="xd24e8668">374</a>]</span>Juan made voluble explanations.
&ldquo;Here is the piping that I have taken the liberty to add,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;These subterranean conduits lead to a sort of cesspool,
thirty yards away. It will help fertilize the garden. There was nothing
of that in the plan. Does it displease you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Quite the contrary, I approve what you&rsquo;ve
done and congratulate you. You are a real architect. From whom did you
learn the business?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From myself, sir,&rdquo; replied the old man
modestly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, before I forget about it&mdash;tell those who
may have scruples, if perhaps there is any one who fears to speak to
me, that I&rsquo;m no longer excommunicated. The Archbishop invited me
to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;</i>, sir, we don&rsquo;t pay any
attention to excommunications! All of us are excommunicated. Padre
Damaso himself is and yet he stays fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, sir, for a year ago he caned the
coadjutor, who is just as much a sacred person as he is. Who pays any
attention to excommunications, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Among the laborers Ibarra caught sight of Elias, who, as
he saluted him along with the others, gave him to understand by a look
that he had something to say to him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&Ntilde;or Juan,&rdquo; said Ibarra, &ldquo;will
you bring me your list of the laborers?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&Ntilde;or Juan disappeared, and Ibarra approached
Elias, who was by himself, lifting a heavy stone into a cart.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you can grant me a few hours&rsquo;
conversation, sir, walk down to the shore of the lake this evening and
get into my banka.&rdquo; The youth nodded, and Elias moved away.</p>
<p class="par">&Ntilde;or Juan now brought the list, but Ibarra scanned
it in vain; the name of Elias did not appear on it! <span class=

<p class="par first">As the sun was sinking below the horizon Ibarra
stepped into Elias&rsquo;s banka at the shore of the lake. The youth
looked out of humor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said Elias sadly, on
seeing him, &ldquo;that I have been so bold as to make this
appointment. I wanted to talk to you freely and so I chose this means,
for here we won&rsquo;t have any listeners. We can return within an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, friend,&rdquo; answered
Ibarra with a forced smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take me to that
town whose belfry we see from here. A mischance forces me to
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A mischance?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. On my way here I met the alferez and he
forced his company on me. I thought of you and remembered that he knows
you, so to get away from him I told him that I was going to that town.
I&rsquo;ll have to stay there all day, since he will look for me
tomorrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but you might
simply have invited him to accompany you,&rdquo; answered Elias
naturally.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have recognized me, since the
only time he ever saw me he wasn&rsquo;t in a position to take careful
note of my appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in bad luck,&rdquo; sighed Ibarra,
thinking of Maria Clara. &ldquo;What did you have to tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias looked about him. They were already at a distance
from the shore, the sun had set, and as in these latitudes there is
scarcely any twilight, the shades were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e8723" href="#xd24e8723" name=
"xd24e8723">376</a>]</span>lengthening, bringing into view the bright
disk of the full moon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Elias gravely, &ldquo;I am
the bearer of the wishes of many unfortunates.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Unfortunates? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In a few words Elias recounted his conversation with the
leader of the tulisanes, omitting the latter&rsquo;s doubts and
threats. Ibarra listened attentively and was the first to break the
long silence that reigned after he had finished his story.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So they want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Radical reforms in the armed forces, in the
priesthood, and in the administration of justice; that is to say, they
ask for paternal treatment from the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Reforms? In what sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For example, more respect for a man&rsquo;s
dignity, more security for the individual, less force in the armed
forces, fewer privileges for that corps which so easily abuses what it
has.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; answered the youth, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know who you are, but I suspect that you are not a man of
the people; you think and act so differently from others. You will
understand me if I tell you that, however imperfect the condition of
affairs may be now, it would be more so if it were changed. I might be
able to get the friends that I have in Madrid to talk, <i>by paying
them</i>; I might even be able to see the Captain-General; but neither
would the former accomplish anything nor has the latter sufficient
power to introduce so many novelties. Nor would I ever take a single
step in that direction, for the reason that, while I fully understand
that it is true that these corporations have their faults, they are
necessary at this time. They are what is known as a necessary
evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Greatly surprised, Elias raised his head and looked at
him in astonishment. &ldquo;Do you, then, also believe in a necessary
evil, sir?&rdquo; he asked in a voice that trembled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8746" href="#xd24e8746" name=
"xd24e8746">377</a>]</span>slightly. &ldquo;Do you believe that in
order to do good it is necessary to do evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, I believe in it as in a violent remedy that
we make use of when we wish to cure a disease. Now then, the country is
an organism suffering from a chronic malady, and in order to cure it,
the government sees the necessity of employing such means, harsh and
violent if you wish, but useful and necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He is a bad doctor, sir, who seeks only to
destroy or stifle the symptoms without an effort to examine into the
origin of the malady, or, when knowing it, fears to attack it. The
Civil Guard has only this purpose: the repression of crime by means of
terror and force, a purpose that it does not fulfil or accomplishes
only incidentally. You must take into account the truth that society
can be severe with individuals only when it has provided them with the
means necessary for their moral perfection. In our country, where there
is no society, since there is no unity between the people and the
government, the latter should be indulgent, not only because indulgence
is necessary but also because the individual, abandoned and uncared for
by it, has less responsibility, for the very reason that he has
received less guidance. Besides, following out your comparison, the
treatment that is applied to the ills of the country is so destructive
that it is felt only in the sound parts of the organism, whose vitality
is thus weakened and made receptive of evil. Would it not be more
rational to strengthen the diseased parts of the organism and lessen
the violence of the remedy a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To weaken the Civil Guard would be to endanger
the security of the towns.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The security of the towns!&rdquo; exclaimed Elias
bitterly. &ldquo;It will soon be fifteen years since the towns have had
their Civil Guard, and look: still we have tulisanes, still we hear
that they sack towns, that they infest the highways. Robberies continue
and the perpetrators are not hunted down; crime flourishes, and the
real criminal goes scot-free, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8757"
href="#xd24e8757" name="xd24e8757">378</a>]</span>but not so the
peaceful inhabitant of the town. Ask any honorable citizen if he looks
upon this institution as a benefit, a protection on the part of the
government, and not as an imposition, a despotism whose outrageous acts
do more damage than the violent deeds of criminals. These latter are
indeed serious, but they are rare, and against them one has the right
to defend himself, but against the molestations of legal force he is
not even allowed a protest, and if they are not serious they are
nevertheless continued and sanctioned. What effect does this
institution produce among our people? It paralyzes communication
because all are afraid of being abused on trifling pretexts. It pays
more attention to formalities than to the real nature of things, which
is the first symptom of incapacity. Because one has forgotten his
cedula he must be manacled and knocked about, regardless of the fact
that he may be a decent and respectable citizen. The superiors hold it
their first duty to make people salute them, either willingly or
forcibly, even in the darkness of the night, and their inferiors
imitate them by mistreating and robbing the country folk, nor are
pretexts lacking to this end. Sanctity of the home does not exist; not
long ago in Kalamba they entered, by forcing their way through the
windows, the house of a peaceful inhabitant to whom their chief owed
money and favors. There is no personal security; when they need to have
their barracks or houses cleaned they go out and arrest any one who
does not resist them, in order to make him work the whole day. Do you
care to hear more? During these holidays gambling, which is prohibited
by law, has gone on while they forcibly broke up the celebrations
permitted by the authorities. You saw what the people thought about
these things; what have they got by repressing their anger and hoping
for human justice? Ah, sir, if that is what you call keeping the
peace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I agree with you that there are evils,&rdquo;
replied Ibarra, &ldquo;but let us bear with those evils on account of
the benefits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8761" href="#xd24e8761"
name="xd24e8761">379</a>]</span>that accompany them. This institution
may be imperfect, but, believe me, by the fear that it inspires it
keeps the number of criminals from increasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Say rather that by this fear the number is
increased,&rdquo; corrected Elias. &ldquo;Before the creation of this
corps almost all the evil-doers, with the exception of a very few, were
criminals from hunger. They plundered and robbed in order to live, but
when their time of want was passed, they again left the highways clear.
Sufficient to put them to flight were the poor, but brave cuadrilleros,
they who have been so calumniated by the writers about our country, who
have for a right, death, for duty, fighting, and for reward, jests. Now
there are tulisanes who are such for life. A single fault, a crime
inhumanly punished, resistance against the outrages of this power, fear
of atrocious tortures, east them out forever from society and condemn
them to slay or be slain. The terrorism of the Civil Guard closes
against them the doors of repentance, and as outlaws they fight to
defend themselves in the mountains better than the soldiers at whom
they laugh. The result is that we are unable to put an end to the evil
that we have created. Remember what the prudence of the Captain-General
de la Torre<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8765src" href="#xd24e8765" name=
"xd24e8765src">1</a> accomplished. The amnesty granted by him to those
unhappy people has proved that in those mountains there still beat the
hearts of men and that they only wait for pardon. Terrorism is useful
when the people are slaves, when the mountains afford no hiding-places,
when power places a sentinel behind every tree, and when the body of
the slave contains nothing more than a stomach and intestines. But when
in desperation he fights for his life, feeling his arm strong, his
heart throb, his whole being fill with hate, how can terrorism hope to
extinguish the flame to which it is only adding fuel?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8769" href=
"#xd24e8769" name="xd24e8769">380</a>]</span>&ldquo;I am perplexed,
Elias, to hear you talk thus, and I should almost believe that you were
right had I not my own convictions. But note this fact&mdash;and
don&rsquo;t be offended, for I consider you an exception&mdash;look who
the men are that ask for these reforms: nearly all criminals or on the
way to be such!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Criminals now, or future criminals; but why are
they such? Because their peace has been disturbed, their happiness
destroyed, their dearest affections wounded, and when they have asked
justice for protection, they have become convinced that they can expect
it only from themselves. But you are mistaken, sir, if you think that
only the criminals ask for justice. Go from town to town, from house to
house, listen to the secret sighings in the bosoms of the families, and
you will be convinced that the evils which the Civil Guard corrects are
the same as, if not less than, those it causes all the time. Should we
decide from this that all the people are criminals? If so, then why
defend some from the others, why not destroy them all?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Some error exists here which I do not see just
now, some fallacy in the theory to invalidate the practise, for in
Spain, the mother country, this corps is displaying, and has ever
displayed, great usefulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it. Perhaps there, it is
better organized, the men of better grade, perhaps also Spain needs it
while the Philippines does not. Our customs, our mode of life, which
are always invoked when there is a desire to deny us some right, are
entirely overlooked when the desire is to impose something upon us. And
tell me, sir, why have not the other nations, which from their nearness
to Spain must be more like her than the Philippines is, adopted this
institution? Is it because of this that they still have fewer robberies
on their railway trains, fewer riots, fewer murders, and fewer
assassinations in their great capitals?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra bowed his head in deep thought, raising it after
a few moments to reply: &ldquo;This question, my friend, calls for
serious study. If my inquiries convince me that these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8779" href="#xd24e8779" name=
"xd24e8779">381</a>]</span>complaints are well founded I will write to
my friends in Madrid, since we have no representatives. Meanwhile,
believe me that the government needs a corps with strength enough to
make itself respected and to enforce its authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir, when the government is at war with the
country. But for the welfare of the government itself we must not have
the people think that they are in opposition to authority. Rather, if
such were true, if we prefer force to prestige, we ought to take care
to whom we grant this unlimited power, this authority. So much power in
the hands of men, ignorant men filled with passions, without moral
training, of untried principles, is a weapon in the hands of a madman
in a defenseless multitude. I concede and wish to believe with you that
the government needs this weapon, but then let it choose this weapon
carefully, let it select the most worthy instruments, and since it
prefers to take upon itself authority, rather than have the people
grant it, at least let it be seen that it knows how to exercise
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias spoke passionately, enthusiastically, in vibrating
tones; his eyes flashed. A solemn pause followed. The banka, unimpelled
by the paddle, seemed to stand still on the water. The moon shone
majestically in a sapphire sky and a few lights glimmered on the
distant shore.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What more do they ask for?&rdquo; inquired
Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Reform in the priesthood,&rdquo; answered Elias
in a sad and discouraged tone. &ldquo;These unfortunates ask for more
protection against&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Against the religious orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Against their oppressors, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Has the Philippines forgotten what she owes to
those orders? Has she forgotten the immense debt of gratitude that is
due from her to those who snatched her from error to give her the true
faith, to those who have protected her against the tyrannical acts of
the civil power? This is the evil result of not knowing the history of
our native land!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8797" href=
"#xd24e8797" name="xd24e8797">382</a>]</span>The surprised Elias could
hardly credit what he heard. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied in a grave
tone, &ldquo;you accuse these people of ingratitude; let me, one of the
people who suffer, defend them. Favors rendered, in order to have any
claims to recognition, must be disinterested. Let us pass over its
missionary work, the much-invoked Christian charity; let us brush
history aside and not ask what Spain has done with the Jewish people,
who gave all Europe a Book, a Religion, and a God; what she has done
with the Arabic people, who gave her culture, who were tolerant with
her religious beliefs, and who awoke her lethargic national spirit, so
nearly destroyed during the Roman and Gothic dominations. You say that
she snatched us from error and gave us the true faith: do you call
faith these outward forms, do you call religion this traffic in girdles
and scapularies, truth these miracles and wonderful tales that we hear
daily? Is this the law of Jesus Christ? For this it was hardly
necessary that a God should allow Himself to be crucified or that we
should be obliged to show eternal gratitude. Superstition existed long
before&mdash;it was only necessary to systematize it and raise the
price of its merchandise!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will tell me that however imperfect our
religion may be at present, it is preferable to what we had before. I
believe that, too, and would agree with you in saying so, but the cost
is too great, since for it we have given up our nationality, our
independence. For it we have given over to its priests our best towns,
our fields, and still give up our savings by the purchase of religious
objects. An article of foreign manufacture has been introduced among
us, we have paid well for it, and we are even.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you mean the protection that they afforded us
against the <i>encomenderos</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8806src"
href="#xd24e8806" name="xd24e8806src">2</a> I might answer that through
them we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8820" href="#xd24e8820"
name="xd24e8820">383</a>]</span>fell under the power of the
<i>encomenderos</i>. But no, I realize that a true faith and a sincere
love for humanity guided the first missionaries to our shores; I
realize the debt of gratitude we owe to those noble hearts; I know that
at that time Spain abounded in heroes of all kinds, in religious as
well as in political affairs, in civil and in military life. But
because the forefathers were virtuous, should we consent to the abuses
of their degenerate descendants? Because they have rendered us great
service, should we be to blame for preventing them from doing us wrong?
The country does not ask for their expulsion but only for reforms
required by the changed circumstances and new needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I love our native land as well as you can, Elias;
I understand something of what it desires, and I have listened with
attention to all you have said. But, after all, my friend, I believe
that we are looking at things through rather impassioned eyes. Here,
less than in other parts, do I see the necessity for
reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it possible, sir,&rdquo; asked Elias,
extending his arms in a gesture of despair, &ldquo;that you do not see
the necessity for reforms, you, after the misfortunes of your
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, I forget myself and my own troubles in the
presence of the security of the Philippines, in the presence of the
interests of Spain!&rdquo; interrupted Ibarra warmly. &ldquo;To
preserve the Philippines it is meet that the friars continue as they
are. On the union with Spain depends the welfare of our
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Ibarra had ceased Elias still sat in an attitude of
attention with a sad countenance and eyes that had lost their luster.
&ldquo;The missionaries conquered the country, it is true,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;but do you believe that by the friars the Philippines
will be preserved?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, by them alone. Such is the belief of all who
have written about the country.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e8836" href="#xd24e8836" name="xd24e8836">384</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Elias dejectedly, throwing
the paddle down in the banka, &ldquo;I did not believe that you would
have so poor an idea of the government and of the country. Why
don&rsquo;t you condemn both? What would you say of the members of a
family that dwells in peace only through the intervention of an
outsider: a country that is obedient because it is deceived; a
government that commands be, cause it avails itself of fraud, a
government that does not know how to make itself loved or respected for
its own sake? Pardon me, sir, but I believe that our government is
stupid and is working its own ruin when it rejoices that such is the
belief. I thank you for your kindness, where do you wish me to take you
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ibarra, &ldquo;let us talk; it
is necessary to see who is right on such an important
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; replied Elias, shaking his
head, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t the eloquence to convince you. Even
though I have had some education I am still an Indian, my way of life
seems to you a precarious one, and my words will always seem to you
suspicious. Those who have given voice to the opposite opinion are
Spaniards, and as such, even though they may speak idly and foolishly,
their tones, their titles, and their origin make their words sacred and
give them such authority that I have desisted forever from arguing
against them. Moreover, when I see that you, who love your country,
you, whose father sleeps beneath these quiet waters, you, who have seen
yourself attacked, insulted, and persecuted, hold such opinions in
spite of all these things, and in spite of your knowledge, I begin to
doubt my own convictions and to admit the possibility that the people
may be mistaken. I&rsquo;ll have to tell those unfortunates who have
put their trust in men that they must place it in God and their own
strength. Again I thank you&mdash;tell me where I shall take
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Elias, your bitter words touch my heart and make
me also doubt. What do you want? I was not brought up among the people,
so I am perhaps ignorant of their needs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e8845" href="#xd24e8845" name="xd24e8845">385</a>]</span>I spent
my childhood in the Jesuit college, I grew up in Europe, I have been
molded by books, learning only what men have been able to bring to
light. What remains among the shadows, what the writers do not tell,
that I am ignorant of. Yet I love our country as you do, not only
because it is the duty of every man to love the country to which he
owes his existence and to which he will no doubt owe his final rest,
not only because my father so taught me, but also because my mother was
an Indian, because my fondest recollections cluster around my country,
and I love it also because to it I owe and shall ever owe my
happiness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I, because to it I owe my misfortunes,&rdquo;
muttered Elias.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, my friend, I know that you suffer, that you
are unfortunate, and that those facts make you look into the future
darkly and influence your way of thinking, so I am somewhat forearmed
against your complaints. If I could understand your motives, something
of your past&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My misfortunes had another source. If I thought
that the story of them would be of any use, I would relate it to you,
since, apart from the fact that I make no secret of it, it is quite
well known to many.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps on hearing it I might correct my
opinions. You know that I do not trust much to theories, preferring
rather to be guided by facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias remained thoughtful for a few moments. &ldquo;If
that is the case, sir, I will tell you my story briefly.&rdquo;

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Some sixty years ago my grandfather dwelt
in Manila, being employed as a bookkeeper in a Spanish commercial
house. He was then very young, was married, and had a son. One night
from some unknown cause the warehouse burned down. The fire was
communicated to the dwelling of his employer and from there to many
other buildings. The losses were great, a scapegoat was sought, and the
merchant accused my grandfather. In vain he protested his innocence,
but he was poor and unable to pay the great lawyers, so he was
condemned to be flogged publicly and paraded through the streets of
Manila. Not so very long since they still used the infamous method of
punishment which the people call the &lsquo;<i lang="es">caballo y
vaca</i>,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8869src" href="#xd24e8869"
name="xd24e8869src">1</a> and which is a thousand times more dreadful
than death itself. Abandoned by all except his young wife, my
grandfather saw himself tied to a horse, followed by an unfeeling
crowd, and whipped on every street-corner in the sight of men, his
brothers, and in the neighborhood of numerous temples of a God of
peace. When the wretch, now forever disgraced, had satisfied the
vengeance of man with his blood, his tortures, and his cries, he had to
be taken off the horse, for he had become unconscious. Would to God
that he had died! But by one of those refinements of cruelty he was
given his liberty. His wife, pregnant at the time, vainly begged from
door to door for work or alms in order to care for her sick husband and
their poor son, but who would trust the wife of an incendiary and a
disgraced man? The wife, then, had to become a prostitute!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8873" href=
"#xd24e8873" name="xd24e8873">387</a>]</span>Ibarra rose in his
seat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get excited! Prostitution was not
now a dishonor for her or a disgrace to her husband; for them honor and
shame no longer existed. The husband recovered from his wounds and came
with his wife and child to hide himself in the mountains of this
province. Here they lived several months, miserable, alone, hated and
shunned by all. The wife gave birth to a sickly child, which
fortunately died. Unable to endure such misery and being less
courageous than his wife, my grandfather, in despair at seeing his sick
wife deprived of all care and assistance, hanged himself. His corpse
rotted in sight of the son, who was scarcely able to care for his sick
mother, and the stench from it led to their discovery. Her
husband&rsquo;s death was attributed to her, for of what is the wife of
a wretch, a woman who has been a prostitute besides, not believed to be
capable? If she swears, they call her a perjurer; if she weeps, they
say that she is acting; and that she blasphemes when she calls on God.
Nevertheless, they had pity on her condition and waited for the birth
of another child before they flogged her. You know how the friars
spread the belief that the Indians can only be managed by blows: read
what Padre Gaspar de San Agustin says!<a class="noteref" id=

condemned will curse the day on which her child is born, and this,
besides prolonging her torture, violates every maternal sentiment.
Unfortunately, she brought forth a healthy child. Two months
afterwards, the sentence was executed to the great satisfaction of the
men who thought that thus they were performing their duty. Not being at
peace in these mountains, she then fled with her two sons to a
neighboring province, where they lived like wild beasts, hating and
hated. The elder of the two boys still remembered, even amid so much
misery, the happiness of his infancy, so he became a tulisan as soon as
he found himself strong enough. Before long the bloody name of Balat
spread from province to province, a terror to the people, because in
his revenge he did everything with blood and fire. The younger, who was
by nature kind-hearted, resigned himself to his shameful fate along
with his mother, and they lived on what the woods afforded, clothing
themselves in the cast-off rags of travelers. She had lost her name,
being known only as <i>the convict, the prostitute, the scourged</i>.
He was known as the son of his mother only, because the gentleness of
his disposition led every one to believe that he was not the son of the
incendiary and because any doubt as to the morality of the Indians can
be held reasonable.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At last, one day the notorious Balat fell into
the clutches of the authorities, who exacted of him a strict accounting
for his crimes, and of his mother for having done nothing to rear him
properly. One morning the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8910"
href="#xd24e8910" name="xd24e8910">389</a>]</span>younger brother went
to look for his mother, who had gone into the woods to gather mushrooms
and had not returned. He found her stretched out on the ground under a
cotton-tree beside the highway, her face turned toward the sky, her
eyes fixed and staring, her clenched hands buried in the blood-stained
earth. Some impulse moved him to look up in the direction toward which
the eyes of the dead woman were staring, and he saw hanging from a
branch a basket and in the basket the gory head of his
brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; ejaculated Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That might have been the exclamation of my
father,&rdquo; continued Elias coldly. &ldquo;The body of the brigand
had been cut up and the trunk buried, but his limbs were distributed
and hung up in different towns. If ever you go from Kalamba to Santo
Tomas you will still see a withered lomboy-tree where one of my
uncle&rsquo;s legs hung rotting&mdash;nature has blasted the tree so
that it no longer grows or bears fruit. The same was done with the
other limbs, but the head, as the best part of the person and the
portion most easily recognizable, was hung up in front of his
mother&rsquo;s hut!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra bowed his head.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The boy fled like one accursed,&rdquo; Elias went
on. &ldquo;He fled from town to town by mountain and valley. When he
thought that he had reached a place where he was not known, he hired
himself out as a laborer in the house of a rich man in the province of
Tayabas. His activity and the gentleness of his character gained him
the good-will of all who did not know his past, and by his thrift and
economy he succeeded in accumulating a little capital. He was still
young, he thought his sorrows buried in the past, and he dreamed of a
happy future. His pleasant appearance, his youth, and his somewhat
unfortunate condition won him the love of a young woman of the town,
but he dared not ask for her hand from fear that his past might become
known. But love is stronger than anything else and they wandered from
the straight path, so, to save the woman&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8920" href="#xd24e8920" name=
"xd24e8920">390</a>]</span>honor, he risked everything by asking for
her in marriage. The records were sought and his whole past became
known. The girl&rsquo;s father was rich and succeeded in having him
prosecuted. He did not try to defend himself but admitted everything,
and so was sent to prison. The woman gave birth to twins, a boy and a
girl, who were nurtured in secret and made to believe that their father
was dead no difficult matter, since at a tender age they saw their
mother die, and they gave little thought to tracing genealogies. As our
maternal grandfather was rich our childhood passed happily. My sister
and I were brought up together, loving one another as only twins can
love when they have no other affections. When quite young I was sent to
study in the Jesuit College, and my sister, in order that we might not
be completely separated, entered the Concordia College.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e8922src" href="#xd24e8922" name="xd24e8922src">3</a>
After our brief education was finished, since we desired only to be
farmers, we returned to the town to take possession of the inheritance
left us by our grandfather. We lived happily for a time, the future
smiled on us, we had many servants, our&rsquo; fields produced abundant
harvests, and my sister was about to be married to a young man whom she
adored and who responded equally to her affection.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But in a dispute over money and by reason of my
haughty disposition at that time, I alienated the good will of a
distant relative, and one day he cast in my face my doubtful birth and
shameful descent. I thought it all a slander and demanded satisfaction.
The tomb which covered so much rottenness was again opened and to my
consternation the whole truth came out to overwhelm me. To add to our
sorrow, we had had for many years an old servant who had endured all my
whims without ever leaving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8928"
href="#xd24e8928" name="xd24e8928">391</a>]</span>us, contenting
himself merely with weeping and groaning at the rough jests of the
other servants. I don&rsquo;t know how my relative had found it out,
but the fact is that he had this old man summoned into court and made
him tell the truth: that old servant, who had clung to his beloved
children, and whom I had abused many times, was my father! Our
happiness faded away, I gave up our fortune, my sister lost her
betrothed, and with our father we left the town to seek refuge
elsewhere. The thought that he had contributed to our misfortunes
shortened the old man&rsquo;s days, but before he died I learned from
his lips the whole story of the sorrowful past.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My sister and I were left alone. She wept a great
deal, but even in the midst of such great sorrows as heaped themselves
upon us, she could not forget her love. Without complaining, without
uttering a word, she saw her former sweetheart married to another girl,
but I watched her gradually sicken without being able to console her.
One day she disappeared, and it was in vain that I sought everywhere,
in vain I made inquiries about her. About six months afterwards I
learned that about that time, after a flood on the lake, there had been
found in some rice fields bordering on the beach at Kalamba, the corpse
of a young woman who had been either drowned or murdered, for she had
had, so they said, a knife sticking in her breast. The officials of
that town published the fact in the country round about, but no one
came to claim the body, no young woman apparently had disappeared. From
the description they gave me afterward of her dress, her ornaments, the
beauty of her countenance, and her abundant hair, I recognized in her
my poor sister.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since then I have wandered from province to
province. My reputation and my history are in the mouths of many. They
attribute great deeds to me, sometimes calumniating me, but I pay
little attention to men, keeping ever on my way. Such in brief is my
story, a story of one of the judgments of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8935" href=
"#xd24e8935" name="xd24e8935">392</a>]</span>Elias fell silent as he
rowed along.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I still believe that you are not wrong,&rdquo;
murmured Crisostomo in a low voice, &ldquo;when you say that justice
should seek to do good by rewarding virtue and educating the criminals.
Only, it&rsquo;s impossible, Utopian! And where could be secured so
much money, so many new employees?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For what, then, are the priests who proclaim
their mission of peace and charity? Is it more meritorious to moisten
the head of a child with water, to give it salt to eat, than to awake
in the benighted conscience of a criminal that spark which God has
granted to every man to light him to his welfare? Is it more humane to
accompany a criminal to the scaffold than to lead him along the
difficult path from vice to virtue? Don&rsquo;t they also pay spies,
executioners, civil-guards? These things, besides being dirty, also
cost money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My friend, neither you nor I, although we may
wish it, can accomplish this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Alone, it is true, we are nothing, but take up
the cause of the people, unite yourself with the people, be not
heedless of their cries, set an example to the rest, spread the idea of
what is called a fatherland!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What the people ask for is impossible. We must
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait! To wait means to suffer!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I should ask for it, the powers that be would
laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But if the people supported you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Never! I will never be the one to lead the
multitude to get by force what the government does not think proper to
grant, no! If I should ever see that multitude armed I would place
myself on the side of the government, for in such a mob I should not
see my countrymen. I desire the country&rsquo;s welfare, therefore I
would build a schoolhouse. I seek it by means of instruction, by
progressive advancement; without light there is no road.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Neither is there liberty without strife!&rdquo;
answered Elias. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8958" href=
"#xd24e8958" name="xd24e8958">393</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The fact is that I don&rsquo;t want that
liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The fact is that without liberty there is no
light,&rdquo; replied the pilot with warmth. &ldquo;You say that you
are only slightly acquainted with your country, and I believe you. You
don&rsquo;t see the struggle that is preparing, you don&rsquo;t see the
cloud on the horizon. The fight is beginning in the sphere of ideas, to
descend later into the arena, which will be dyed with blood. I hear the
voice of God&mdash;woe unto them who would oppose it! For them History
has not been written!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias was transfigured; standing uncovered, with his
manly face illuminated by the moon, there was something extraordinary
about him. He shook his long hair, and went on:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how everything is awakening?
The sleep has lasted for centuries, but one day the
thunderbolt<a class="noteref" id="xd24e8967src" href="#xd24e8967" name=
"xd24e8967src">4</a> struck, and in striking, infused life. Since then
new tendencies are stirring our spirits, and these tendencies, today
scattered, will some day be united, guided by the God who has not
failed other peoples and who will not fail us, for His cause is the
cause of liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A solemn silence followed these words, while the banka,
carried along insensibly by the waves, neared the shore.</p>
<p class="par">Elias was the first to break the silence. &ldquo;What
shall I tell those who sent me?&rdquo; he asked with a change from his
former tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you: I greatly deplore
their condition, but they should wait. Evils are not remedied by other
evils, and in our misfortunes each of us has his share of
blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias did not again reply, but dropped his head and
rowed along until they reached the shore, where he took leave of
Ibarra: &ldquo;I thank you, sir, for the condescension you have shown
me. Now, for your own good, I beg of you that in the future you forget
me and that you do not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8978" href=
"#xd24e8978" name="xd24e8978">394</a>]</span>recognize me again, no
matter in what situation you may find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So saying, he drew away in the banka, rowing toward a
thicket on the shore. As he covered the long distance he remained
silent, apparently intent upon nothing but the thousands of
phosphorescent diamonds that the oar caught up and dropped back into
the lake, where they disappeared mysteriously into the blue waves.</p>
<p class="par">When he had reached the shadow of the thicket a man came
out of it and approached the banka. &ldquo;What shall I tell the
capitan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell him that Elias, if he lives, will keep his
word,&rdquo; was the sad answer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When will you join us, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When your capitan thinks that the hour of danger
has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well. Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t die first,&rdquo; added Elias in
a low voice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e8995" href="#xd24e8995"

Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., who came to the Philippines in 1668 and
died in Manila in 1724, was the author of a history of the conquest,
but his chief claim to immortality comes from a letter written in 1720
on the character and habits of &ldquo;the Indian inhabitants of these
islands,&rdquo; a letter which was widely circulated and which has been
extensively used by other writers. In it the writer with senile
querulousness harped up and down the whole gamut of abuse in describing
and commenting upon the vices of the natives, very artlessly revealing
the fact in many places, however, that his observations were drawn
principally from the conduct of the servants in the conventos and homes
of Spaniards. To him in this letter is due the credit of giving its
wide popularity to the specious couplet:</p>

<p class="par footnote cont">It seems somewhat strange that a spiritual
father should have written in such terms about his charges until the
fact appears that the letter was addressed to an influential friend in
Spain for use in opposition to a proposal to carry out the provisions
of the Council of Trent by turning the parishes in the islands over to
the secular, and hence, native, clergy. A translation of this bilious
tirade, with copious annotations showing to what a great extent it has
been used by other writers, appears in Volume XL of Blair and

<p class="par first">The bashful Linares was anxious and ill at ease.
He had just received from Do&ntilde;a Victorina a letter which ran
thus:</p>

<p class="par">sampaloc monday 7 in the evening</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The affair was serious. He was well enough acquainted
with the character of Do&ntilde;a Victorina to know what she was
capable of. To talk to her of reason was to talk of honesty and
courtesy to a revenue carbineer when he proposes to find contraband
where there is none, to plead with her would be useless, to deceive her
worse&mdash;there was no way out of the difficulty but to send the
challenge.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But how? Suppose he receives me with
violence?&rdquo; he soliloquized, as he paced to and fro.
&ldquo;Suppose I find him with his se&ntilde;ora? Who will be willing
to be my second? The curate? Capitan Tiago? Damn the hour in which I
listened to her advice! The old toady! To oblige me to get myself
tangled up, to tell lies, to make a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e9015" href="#xd24e9015" name=
"xd24e9015">396</a>]</span>blustering fool of myself! What will the
young lady say about me? Now I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;ve been
secretary to all the ministers!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">While the good Linares was in the midst of his
soliloquy, Padre Salvi came in. The Franciscan was even thinner and
paler than usual, but his eyes gleamed with a strange light and his
lips wore a peculiar smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Linares, all alone?&rdquo; was his
greeting as he made his way to the sala, through the half-opened door
of which floated the notes from a piano. Linares tried to smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where is Don Santiago?&rdquo; continued the
curate.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago at that moment appeared, kissed the
curate&rsquo;s hand, and relieved him of his hat and cane, smiling all
the while like one of the blessed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; exclaimed the curate, entering
the sala, followed by Linares and Capitan Tiago, &ldquo;I have good
news for you all. I&rsquo;ve just received letters from Manila which
confirm the one Se&ntilde;or Ibarra brought me yesterday. So, Don
Santiago, the objection is removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara, who was seated at the piano between her two
friends, partly rose, but her strength failed her, and she fell back
again. Linares turned pale and looked at Capitan Tiago, who dropped his
eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That young man seems to me to be very
agreeable,&rdquo; continued the curate. &ldquo;At first I misjudged
him&mdash;he&rsquo;s a little quick-tempered&mdash;but he knows so well
how to atone for his faults afterwards that one can&rsquo;t hold
anything against him. If it were not for Padre Damaso&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here the curate shot a quick glance at Maria Clara, who
was listening without taking her eyes off the sheet of music, in spite
of the sly pinches of Sinang, who was thus expressing her joy&mdash;had
she been alone she would have danced.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre Damaso?&rdquo; queried Linares.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, Padre Damaso has said,&rdquo; the curate
went on, without taking his gaze from Maria Clara, &ldquo;that
as&mdash;being her sponsor in baptism, he can&rsquo;t permit&mdash;but,
after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9038" href="#xd24e9038" name=
"xd24e9038">397</a>]</span>all, I believe that if Se&ntilde;or Ibarra
begs his pardon, which I don&rsquo;t doubt he&rsquo;ll do, everything
will be settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara rose, made some excuse, and retired to her
chamber, accompanied by Victoria.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But if Padre Damaso doesn&rsquo;t pardon
him?&rdquo; asked Capitan Tiago in a low voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then Maria Clara will decide. Padre Damaso is her
father&mdash;spiritually. But I think they&rsquo;ll reach an
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that moment footsteps were heard and Ibarra appeared,
followed by Aunt Isabel. His appearance produced varied impressions. To
his affable greeting Capitan Tiago did not know whether to laugh or to
cry. He acknowledged the presence of Linares with a profound bow. Fray
Salvi arose and extended his hand so cordially that the youth could not
restrain a look of astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; said Fray Salvi,
&ldquo;for I was just now praising you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra thanked him and went up to Sinang, who began with
her childish garrulity, &ldquo;Where have you been all day? We were all
asking, where can that soul redeemed from purgatory have gone? And we
all said the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May I know what you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s a secret, but I&rsquo;ll tell
you soon alone. Now tell me where you&rsquo;ve been, so we can see who
guessed right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s also a secret, but I&rsquo;ll
tell you alone, if these gentlemen will excuse us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, by all means!&rdquo;
exclaimed Padre Salvi.</p>
<p class="par">Rejoicing over the prospect of learning a secret, Sinang
led Crisostomo to one end of the sala.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell me, little friend,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;is Maria angry with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but she says that it&rsquo;s
better for you to forget her, then she begins to cry. Capitan Tiago
wants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9067" href="#xd24e9067" name=
"xd24e9067">398</a>]</span>her to marry that man. So does Padre Damaso,
but she doesn&rsquo;t say either yes or no. This morning when we were
talking about you and I said, &lsquo;Suppose he has gone to make love
to some other girl?&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;Would that he
had!&rsquo; and began to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra became grave. &ldquo;Tell Maria that I want to
talk with her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; asked Sinang, wrinkling her
eyebrows and staring at him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Entirely alone, no, but not with that fellow
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather difficult, but don&rsquo;t
worry, I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When shall I have an answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tomorrow come to my house early. Maria
doesn&rsquo;t want to be left alone at all, so we stay with her.
Victoria sleeps with her one night and I the other, and tonight
it&rsquo;s my turn. But listen, your secret? Are you going away without
telling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I was in the town of Los
Ba&ntilde;os. I&rsquo;m going to develop some coconut-groves and
I&rsquo;m thinking of putting up an oil-mill. Your father will be my
partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing more than that? What a secret!&rdquo;
exclaimed Sinang aloud, in the tone of a cheated usurer. &ldquo;I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be careful! I don&rsquo;t want you to make it
known!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor do I want to do it,&rdquo; replied Sinang,
turning up her nose. &ldquo;If it were something more important, I
would tell my friends. But to buy coconuts! Coconuts! Who&rsquo;s
interested in coconuts?&rdquo; And with extraordinary haste she ran to
join her friends.</p>
<p class="par">A few minutes later Ibarra, seeing that the interest of
the party could only languish, took his leave. Capitan Tiago wore a
bitter-sweet look, Linares was silent and watchful, while the curate
with assumed cheerfulness talked of indifferent matters. None of the
girls had reappeared. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9092" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The moon was hidden in a cloudy sky while a cold
wind, precursor of the approaching December, swept the dry leaves and
dust about in the narrow pathway leading to the cemetery. Three shadowy
forms were conversing in low tones under the arch of the gateway.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you spoken to Elias?&rdquo; asked a
voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, you know how reserved and circumspect he is.
But he ought to be one of us. Don Crisostomo saved his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I joined,&rdquo; said the first
voice. &ldquo;Don Crisostomo had my wife cured in the house of a doctor
in Manila. I&rsquo;ll look after the convento to settle some old scores
with the curate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll take care of the barracks to show
the civil-guards that our father had sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How many of us will there be?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Five, and five will be enough. Don
Crisostomo&rsquo;s servant, though, says there&rsquo;ll be twenty of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What if you don&rsquo;t succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the shadows, and
all fell silent.</p>
<p class="par">In the semi-obscurity a shadowy figure was seen to
approach, sneaking along by the fence. From time to time it stopped as
if to look back. Nor was reason for this movement lacking, since some
twenty paces behind it came another figure, larger and apparently
darker than the first, but so lightly did it touch the ground that it
vanished as rapidly as though the earth had swallowed it every time the
first shadow paused and turned.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9120" href=
"#xd24e9120" name="xd24e9120">400</a>]</span>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re
following me,&rdquo; muttered the first figure. &ldquo;Can it be the
civil-guards? Did the senior sacristan lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They said that they would meet here,&rdquo;
thought the second shadow. &ldquo;Some mischief must be on foot when
the two brothers conceal it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At length the first shadow reached the gateway of the
cemetery. The three who were already there stepped forward.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must scatter, for they&rsquo;ve followed me.
Tomorrow you&rsquo;ll get the arms and tomorrow night is the time. The
cry is, &lsquo;Viva Don Crisostomo!&rsquo; Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The three shadows disappeared behind the stone walls.
The later arrival hid in the hollow of the gateway and waited silently.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;s following me,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p class="par">The second shadow came up very cautiously and paused as
if to look about him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m late,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;but perhaps they will return.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A thin fine rain, which threatened to last, began to
fall, so it occurred to him to take refuge under the gateway.
Naturally, he ran against the other.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah! Who are you?&rdquo; asked the latest arrival
in a rough tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; returned the other calmly,
after which there followed a moment&rsquo;s pause as each tried to
recognize the other&rsquo;s voice and to make out his features.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you waiting here for?&rdquo; asked he of
the rough voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For the clock to strike eight so that I can play
cards with the dead. I want to win something tonight,&rdquo; answered
the other in a natural tone. &ldquo;And you, what have you come
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For&mdash;for the same purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ab&aacute;!</i> I&rsquo;m glad of that,
I&rsquo;ll not be alone. I&rsquo;ve <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e9154" href="#xd24e9154" name="xd24e9154">401</a>]</span>brought
cards. At the first stroke of the bell I&rsquo;ll make the lay, at the
second I&rsquo;ll deal. The cards that move are the cards of the dead
and we&rsquo;ll have to cut for them. Have you brought
cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple enough&mdash;just as
you&rsquo;re going to deal for them, so I expect them to play for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what if the dead don&rsquo;t play?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What can we do? Gambling hasn&rsquo;t yet been
made compulsory among the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A short silence ensued.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you armed? How are you going to fight with
the dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With my fists,&rdquo; answered the larger of the
two.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, the devil! Now I remember&mdash;the dead
won&rsquo;t bet when there&rsquo;s more than one living person, and
there are two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is that right? Well, I don&rsquo;t want to
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor I. I&rsquo;m short of money,&rdquo; answered
the smaller. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s do this: let&rsquo;s play for it,
the one who loses to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the other, rather
ungraciously. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get inside. Have you any
matches?&rdquo; They went in to seek in the semi-obscurity for a
suitable place and soon found a niche in which they could sit. The
shorter took some cards from his salakot, while the other struck a
match, in the light from which they stared at each other, but, from the
expressions on their faces, apparently without recognition.
Nevertheless, we can recognize in the taller and deep-voiced one Elias
and in the shorter one, from the scar on his cheek, Lucas.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cut!&rdquo; called Lucas, still staring at the
other. He pushed aside some bones that were in the niche and dealt an
ace and a jack.</p>
<p class="par">Elias lighted match after match. &ldquo;On the
jack!&rdquo; he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9185" href=
"#xd24e9185" name="xd24e9185">402</a>]</span>said, and to indicate the
card placed a vertebra on top of it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; called Lucas, as he dealt an ace
with the fourth or fifth card. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;Now leave me alone so that I can try to make a
raise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias moved away without a word and was soon swallowed
up in the darkness.</p>
<p class="par">Several minutes later the church-clock struck eight and
the bell announced the hour of the souls, but Lucas invited no one to
play nor did he call on the dead, as the superstition directs; instead,
he took off his hat and muttered a few prayers, crossing and recrossing
himself with the same fervor with which, at that same moment, the
leader of the Brotherhood of the Holy Rosary was going through a
similar performance.</p>
<p class="par">Throughout the night a drizzling rain continued to fall.
By nine o&rsquo;clock the streets were dark and solitary. The
coconut-oil lanterns, which the inhabitants were required to hang out,
scarcely illuminated a small circle around each, seeming to be lighted
only to render the darkness more apparent. Two civil-guards paced back
and forth in the street near the church.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; said one in Tagalog with
a Visayan accent. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t caught any sacristan, so
there is no one to repair the alferez&rsquo;s chicken-coop.
They&rsquo;re all scared out by the death of that other one. This makes
me tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;No one
commits robbery, no one raises a disturbance, but, thank God, they say
that Elias is in town. The alferez says that whoever catches him will
be exempt from floggings for three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aha! Do you remember his description?&rdquo;
asked the Visayan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should say so! Height: tall, according to the
alferez, medium, according to Padre Damaso; color, brown; eyes, black;
nose, ordinary; beard, none; hair, black.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aha! But special marks?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Black shirt, black pantaloons,
wood-cutter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9209" href=
"#xd24e9209" name="xd24e9209">403</a>]</span>&ldquo;Aha, he won&rsquo;t
get away from me! I think I see him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mistake him for any one else,
even though he might look like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thus the two soldiers continued on their round.</p>
<p class="par">By the light of the lanterns we may again see two
shadowy figures moving cautiously along, one behind the other. An
energetic &ldquo;<i>Qui&eacute;n vive?</i>&rdquo; stops both, and the
first answers, &ldquo;<i>Espa&ntilde;a!</i>&rdquo; in a trembling
voice.</p>
<p class="par">The soldiers seize him and hustle him toward a lantern
to examine him. It is Lucas, but the soldiers seem to be in doubt,
questioning each other with their eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The alferez didn&rsquo;t say that he had a
scar,&rdquo; whispered the Visayan. &ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To order a mass for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen Elias?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him, sir,&rdquo; answered
Lucas.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you if you know him, you fool!
Neither do we know him. I&rsquo;m asking you if you&rsquo;ve seen
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;ll describe him: Height,
sometimes tall, sometimes medium; hair and eyes, black; all the other
features, ordinary,&rdquo; recited the Visayan. &ldquo;Now do you know
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Lucas stupidly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then get away from here! Brute! Dolt!&rdquo; And
they gave him a shove.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know why Elias is tall to the alferez and
of medium height to the curate?&rdquo; asked the Tagalog
thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Visayan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because the alferez was down in the mudhole when
he saw him and the curate was on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed the Visayan.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talented&mdash;blow is it that you&rsquo;re a
civil-guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t always one; I was a
smuggler,&rdquo; answered the Tagalog with a touch of pride.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9256" href=
"#xd24e9256" name="xd24e9256">404</a>]</span>But another shadowy figure
diverted their attention. They challenged this one also and took the
man to the light.</p>
<p class="par">This time it was the real Elias.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To look for a man, sir, who beat and threatened
my brother. He has a scar on his face and is called Elias.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; exclaimed the two guards, gazing at
each other in astonishment, as they started on the run toward the
church, where Lucas had disappeared a few moments before. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Early the next morning the report spread through
the town that many lights had been seen in the cemetery on the previous
night. The leader of the Venerable Tertiary Order spoke of lighted
candles, of their shape and size, and, although he could not fix the
exact number, had counted more than twenty. Sister Sipa, of the
Brotherhood of the Holy Rosary, could not bear the thought that a
member of a rival order should alone boast of having seen this divine
marvel, so she, even though she did not live near the place, had heard
cries and groans, and even thought she recognized by their voices
certain persons with whom she, in other times,&mdash;but out of
Christian charity she not only forgave them but prayed for them and
would keep their names secret, for all of which she was declared on the
spot to be a saint. Sister Rufa was not so keen of hearing, but she
could not suffer that Sister Sipa had heard so much and she nothing, so
she related a dream in which there had appeared before her many
souls&mdash;not only of the dead but even of the living&mdash;souls in
torment who begged for a part of those indulgences of hers which were
so carefully recorded and treasured. She could furnish names to the
families interested and only asked for a few alms to succor the Pope in
his needs. A little fellow, a herder, who dared to assert that he had
seen nothing more than one light and two men in salakots had difficulty
in escaping with mere slaps and scoldings. Vainly he swore to it; there
were his carabaos with him and could verify his statement. &ldquo;Do
you pretend to know more than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e9276" href="#xd24e9276" name="xd24e9276">406</a>]</span>Warden
and the Sisters, <i>paracmason</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9281src"
href="#xd24e9281" name="xd24e9281src">2</a> heretic?&rdquo; he was
asked amid angry looks. The curate went up into the pulpit and preached
about purgatory so fervently that the pesos again flowed forth from
their hiding-places to pay for masses.</p>
<p class="par">But let us leave the suffering souls and listen to the
conversation between Don Filipo and old Tasio in the lonely home of the
latter. The Sage, or Lunatic, was sick, having been for days unable to
leave his bed, prostrated by a malady that was rapidly growing
worse.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t know whether to
congratulate you or not that your resignation has been accepted.
Formerly, when the gobernadorcillo so shamelessly disregarded the will
of the majority, it was right for you to tender it, but now that you
are engaged in a contest with the Civil Guard it&rsquo;s not quite
proper. In time of war you ought to remain at your post.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, but not when the general sells
himself,&rdquo; answered Don Filipo. &ldquo;You know that on the
following morning the gobernadorcillo liberated the soldiers that I had
succeeded in arresting and refused to take any further action. Without
the consent of my superior officer I could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You alone, nothing; but with the rest, much. You
should have taken advantage of this opportunity to set an example to
the other towns. Above the ridiculous authority of the gobernadorcillo
are the rights of the people. It was the beginning of a good lesson and
you have neglected it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what could I have done against the
representative of the interests? Here you have Se&ntilde;or Ibarra, he
has bowed before the beliefs of the crowd. Do you think that he
believes in excommunications?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are not in the same fix. Se&ntilde;or Ibarra
is trying to sow the good seed, and to do so he must bend himself and
make what use he can of the material at hand. Your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9298" href="#xd24e9298" name=
"xd24e9298">407</a>]</span>mission was to stir things up, and for that
purpose initiative and force are required. Besides, the fight should
not be considered as merely against the gobernadorcillo. The principle
ought to be, against him who makes wrong use of his authority, against
him who disturbs the public peace, against him who fails in his duty.
You would not have been alone, for the country is not the same now that
it was twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Don Filipo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel it?&rdquo; rejoined the old
man, sitting up in his bed. &ldquo;Ah, that is because you
haven&rsquo;t seen the past, you haven&rsquo;t studied the effect of
European immigration, of the coming of new books, and of the movement
of our youth to Europe. Examine and compare these facts. It is true
that the Royal and Pontifical University of Santo Tomas, with its most
sapient faculty, still exists and that some intelligences are yet
exercised in formulating distinctions and in penetrating the subtleties
of scholasticism; but where will you now find the metaphysical youth of
our days, with their archaic education, who tortured their brains and
died in full pursuit of sophistries in some corner of the provinces,
without ever having succeeded in understanding the attributes of
<i>being</i>, or solving the problem of <i>essence</i> and
<i>existence</i>, those lofty concepts that made us forget what was
essential,&mdash;our own existence and our own individuality? Look at
the youth of today! Full of enthusiasm at the view of a wider horizon,
they study history, mathematics, geography, literature, physical
sciences, languages&mdash;all subjects that in our times we heard
mentioned with horror, as though they were heresies. The greatest
free-thinker of my day declared them inferior to the classifications of
Aristotle and the laws of the syllogism. Man has at last comprehended
that he is man; he has given up analyzing his God and searching into
the imperceptible, into what he has not seen; he has given up framing
laws for the phantasms of his brain; he comprehends that his heritage
is the vast world, dominion over which is within <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9313" href="#xd24e9313" name=
"xd24e9313">408</a>]</span>his reach; weary of his useless and
presumptuous toil, he lowers his head and examines what surrounds him.
See how poets are now springing up among us! The Muses of Nature are
gradually opening up their treasures to us and begin to smile in
encouragement on our efforts; the experimental sciences have already
borne their first-fruits; time only is lacking for their development.
The lawyers of today are being trained in the new forms of the
philosophy of law, some of them begin to shine in the midst of the
shadows which surround our courts of justice, indicating a change in
the course of affairs. Hear how the youth talk, visit the centers of
learning! Other names resound within the walls of the schools, there
where we heard only those of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Thomas, Suarez, Amat, Sanchez,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9319src" href="#xd24e9319" name="xd24e9319src">3</a>
and others who were the idols of our times. In vain do the friars cry
out from the pulpits against our demoralization, as the fish-venders
cry out against the cupidity of their customers, disregarding the fact
that their wares are stale and unserviceable! In vain do the conventos
extend their ramifications to check the new current. The gods are
going! The roots of the tree may weaken the plants that support
themselves under it, but they <span class="corr" id="xd24e9322" title=
"Source: canot">cannot</span> take away life from those other beings,
which, like birds, are soaring toward the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Sage spoke with animation, his eyes gleamed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Still, the new seed is small,&rdquo; objected Don
Filipo incredulously. &ldquo;If all enter upon the progress we purchase
so dearly, it may be stifled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Stifled! Who will stifle it? Man, that weak
dwarf, stifle progress, the powerful child of time and action? When has
he been able to do so? Bigotry, the gibbet, the stake, by endeavoring
to stifle it, have hurried it along. <i>E pur si muove</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e9335src" href="#xd24e9335" name="xd24e9335src">4</a>
said Galileo, when the Dominicans forced him to declare that the earth
does not move, and the same statement might be applied to human
progress. Some wills <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9338" href=
"#xd24e9338" name="xd24e9338">409</a>]</span>are broken down, some
individuals sacrificed, but that is of little import; progress
continues on its way, and from the blood of those who fall new and
vigorous offspring is born. See, the press itself, however backward it
may wish to be, is taking a step forward. The Dominicans themselves do
not escape the operation of this law, but are imitating the Jesuits,
their irreconcilable enemies. They hold fiestas in their cloisters,
they erect little theaters, they compose poems, because, as they are
not devoid of intelligence in spite of believing in the fifteenth
century, they realize that the Jesuits are right, and they will still
take part in the future of the younger peoples that they have
reared.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So, according to you, the Jesuits keep up with
<span class="corr" id="xd24e9342" title=
"Source: proggress">progress</span>?&rdquo; asked Don Filipo in wonder.
&ldquo;Why, then, are they opposed in Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will answer you like an old scholastic,&rdquo;
replied the Sage, lying down again and resuming his jesting expression.
&ldquo;There are three ways in which one may accompany the course of
progress: in front of, beside, or behind it. The first guide it, the
second suffer themselves to be carried along with it, and the last are
dragged after it and to these last the Jesuits belong. They would like
to direct it, but as they see that it is strong and has other
tendencies, they capitulate, preferring to follow rather than to be
crushed or left alone among the shadows by the wayside. Well now, we in
the Philippines are moving along at least three centuries behind the
car of progress; we are barely beginning to emerge from the Middle
Ages. Hence the Jesuits, who are reactionary in Europe, when seen from
our point of view, represent progress. To them the Philippines owes her
dawning system of instruction in the natural sciences, the soul of the
nineteenth century, as she owed to the Dominicans scholasticism,
already dead in spite of Leo XIII, for there is no Pope who can revive
what common sense has judged and condemned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But where are we getting to?&rdquo; he asked with
a change <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9349" href="#xd24e9349"
name="xd24e9349">410</a>]</span>of tone. &ldquo;Ah, we were speaking of
the present condition of the Philippines. Yes, we are now entering upon
a period of strife, or rather, I should say that you are, for my
generation belongs to the night, we are passing away. This strife is
between the past, which seizes and strives with curses to cling to the
tottering feudal castle, and the future, whose song of triumph may be
heard from afar amid the splendors of the coming dawn, bringing the
message of Good-News from other lands. Who will fall and be buried in
the moldering ruins?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man paused. Noticing that Don Filipo was gazing
at him thoughtfully, he said with a smile, &ldquo;I can almost guess
what you are thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are thinking of how easily I may be
mistaken,&rdquo; was the answer with a sad smile. &ldquo;Today I am
feverish, and I am not infallible: <i>homo sum et nihil humani a me
alienum puto</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e9360src" href="#xd24e9360"
name="xd24e9360src">5</a> said Terence, and if at any time one is
allowed to dream, why not dream pleasantly in the last hours of life?
And after all, I have lived only in dreams! You are right, it is a
dream! Our youths think only of love affairs and dissipations; they
expend more time and work harder to deceive and dishonor a maiden than
in thinking about the welfare of their country; our women, in order to
care for the house and family of God, neglect their own: our men are
active only in vice and heroic only in shame; childhood develops amid
ignorance and routine, youth lives its best years without ideals, and a
sterile manhood serves only as an example for corrupting youth. Gladly
do I die! <i>Claudite iam rivos, pueri!</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd24e9366src" href="#xd24e9366" name="xd24e9366src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want some medicine?&rdquo; asked
Don Filipo in order to change the course of the conversation, which had
darkened the old man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9372" href=
"#xd24e9372" name="xd24e9372">411</a>]</span>&ldquo;The dying need no
medicines; you who remain need them. Tell Don Crisostomo to come and
see me tomorrow, for I have some important things to say to him. In a
few days I am going away. The Philippines is in darkness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After a few moments more of talk, Don Filipo left the
sick man&rsquo;s house, grave and thoughtful. <span class=

<p class="par first">The vesper bells are ringing, and at the holy
sound all pause, drop their tasks, and uncover. The laborer returning
from the fields ceases the song with which he was pacing his carabao
and murmurs a prayer, the women in the street cross themselves and move
their lips affectedly so that none may doubt their piety, a man stops
caressing his game-cock and recites the angelus to bring better luck,
while inside the houses they pray aloud. Every sound but that of the
Ave Maria dies away, becomes hushed.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, the curate, without his hat, rushes across
the street, to the scandalizing of many old women, and, greater scandal
still, directs his steps toward the house of the alferez. The devout
women then think it time to cease the movement of their lips in order
to kiss the curate&rsquo;s hand, but Padre Salvi takes no notice of
them. This evening he finds no pleasure in placing his bony hand on his
Christian nose that he may slip it down dissemblingly (as Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion has observed) over the bosom of the attractive young woman
who may have bent over to receive his blessing. Some important matter
must be engaging his attention when he thus forgets his own interests
and those of the Church!</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9414" href=
"#xd24e9414" name="xd24e9414">413</a>]</span>In fact, he rushes
headlong up the stairway and knocks impatiently at the alferez&rsquo;s
door. The latter puts in his appearance, scowling, followed by his
better half, who smiles like one of the damned.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, Padre, I was just going over to see you. That
old goat of yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have a very important matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand for his running about and
breaking down the fence. I&rsquo;ll shoot him if he comes
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is, if you are alive tomorrow!&rdquo;
exclaimed the panting curate as he made his way toward the sala.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What, do you think that puny doll will kill me?
I&rsquo;ll bust him with a kick!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi stepped backward with an involuntary glance
toward the alferez&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;Whom are you talking
about?&rdquo; he asked tremblingly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;About whom would I talk but that simpleton who
has challenged me to a duel with revolvers at a hundred
paces?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the curate, then he added,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to talk to you about a very urgent
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Enough of urgent matters! It&rsquo;ll be like
that affair of the two boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Had the light been other than from coconut oil and the
lamp globe not so dirty, the alferez would have noticed the
curate&rsquo;s pallor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now this is a serious matter, which concerns the
lives of all of us,&rdquo; declared Padre Salvi in a low voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A serious matter?&rdquo; echoed the alferez,
turning pale. &ldquo;Can that boy shoot straight?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The friar made a sign toward the door, which the alferez
closed in his own way&mdash;with a kick, for he had found his hands
superfluous and had lost nothing by ceasing to be bimanous.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9448" href=

outside. &ldquo;Brute, you&rsquo;ve split my forehead open!&rdquo;
yelled his wife.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, unburden yourself,&rdquo; he said calmly to
the curate.</p>
<p class="par">The latter stared at him for a space, then asked in the
nasal, droning voice of the preacher, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see me
come&mdash;running?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sure! I thought you&rsquo;d lost
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; continued the curate, without
heeding the alferez&rsquo;s rudeness, &ldquo;when I fail thus in my
duty, it&rsquo;s because there are grave reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, what else?&rdquo; asked the other, tapping
the floor with his foot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be calm!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then why did you come in such a hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The curate drew nearer to him and asked mysteriously,
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t&mdash;you&mdash;heard&mdash;anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You admit that you know absolutely
nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you want to talk about Elias, who put away
your senior sacristan last night?&rdquo; was the retort.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not talking about those
matters,&rdquo; answered the curate ill-naturedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
talking about a great danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, damn it, out with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the friar slowly and
disdainfully, &ldquo;you see once more how important we ecclesiastics
are. The meanest lay brother is worth as much as a regiment, while a
curate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he added in a low and mysterious tone,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve discovered a big conspiracy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez started up and gazed in astonishment at the
friar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A terrible and well-organized plot, which will be
carried out this very night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This very night!&rdquo; exclaimed the alferez,
pushing the curate aside and running to his revolver and sword hanging
on the wall.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9489" href=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Calm yourself! There is still time, thanks to the
promptness with which I have acted. We have till eight
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot all of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen<i>!</i> This afternoon a woman whose name
I can&rsquo;t reveal (it&rsquo;s a secret of the confessional) came to
me and told everything. At eight o&rsquo;clock they will seize the
barracks by surprise, plunder the convento, capture the police boat,
and murder all of us Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez was stupefied.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The woman did not tell me any more than
this,&rdquo; added the curate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t tell any more? Then I&rsquo;ll
arrest her!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t consent to that. The bar of
penitence is the throne of the God of mercies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s neither God nor mercies that amount
to anything! I&rsquo;ll arrest her!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing your head! What you must do
is to get yourself ready. Muster your soldiers quietly and put them in
ambush, send me four guards for the convento, and notify the men in
charge of the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The boat isn&rsquo;t here. I&rsquo;ll ask for
help from the other sections.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, for then the plotters would be warned and
would not carry out their plans. What we must do is to catch them alive
and make them talk&mdash;I mean, you&rsquo;ll make them talk, since I,
as a priest, must not meddle in such matters. Listen, here&rsquo;s
where you win crosses and stars. I ask only that you make due
acknowledgment that it was I who warned you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be acknowledged, Padre, it&rsquo;ll
be acknowledged&mdash;and perhaps you&rsquo;ll get a miter!&rdquo;
answered the glowing alferez, glancing at the cuffs of his uniform.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So, you send me four guards in plain clothes, eh?
Be discreet, and tonight at eight o&rsquo;clock it&rsquo;ll rain stars
and crosses.&rdquo;</p>

place, a man ran along the road leading to Ibarra&rsquo;s house and
rushed up the stairway.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is your master here?&rdquo; the voice of Elias
called to a servant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in his study at work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra, to divert the impatience that he felt while
waiting for the time when he could make his explanations to Maria
Clara, had set himself to work in his laboratory.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, that you, Elias?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I was thinking about you. Yesterday I forgot to ask you the name
of that Spaniard in whose house your grandfather lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not talk about me,
sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; continued Ibarra, not noticing the
youth&rsquo;s agitation, while he placed a piece of bamboo over a
flame, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a great discovery. This bamboo is
incombustible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a question of bamboo now, sir,
it&rsquo;s a question of your collecting your papers and fleeing at
this very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra glanced at him in surprise and, on seeing the
gravity of his countenance, dropped the object that he held in his
hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Burn everything that may compromise you and
within an hour put yourself in a place of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Ibarra was at length able to ask.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Put all your valuables in a safe
place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Burn every letter written by you or to
you&mdash;the most innocent thing may be wrongly
construed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But why all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why! Because I&rsquo;ve just discovered a plot
that is to be attributed to you in order to ruin you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A plot? Who is forming it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to discover the author
of it, but just a moment ago I talked with one of the poor dupes who
are paid to carry it out, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to dissuade
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9561" href=
"#xd24e9561" name="xd24e9561">417</a>]</span>&ldquo;But
he&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he tell you who is paying him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes! Under a pledge of secrecy he said that it
was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed the terrified
Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of it, sir. Don&rsquo;t
lose any time, for the plot will probably be carried out this very
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra, with his hands on his head and his eyes staring
unnaturally, seemed not to hear him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The blow cannot be averted,&rdquo; continued
Elias. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come late, I don&rsquo;t know who the leaders
are. Save yourself, sir, save yourself for your country&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whither shall I flee? She expects me
tonight!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra, thinking of Maria Clara.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To any town whatsoever, to Manila, to the house
of some official, but anywhere so that they may not say that you are
directing this movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Suppose that I myself report the plot?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You an informer!&rdquo; exclaimed Elias, stepping
back and staring at him. &ldquo;You would appear as a traitor and
coward in the eyes of the plotters and faint-hearted in the eyes of
others. They would say that you planned the whole thing to curry favor.
They would say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already told you. Destroy every
document that relates to your affairs, flee, and await the
outcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And Maria Clara?&rdquo; exclaimed the young man.
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll die first!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias wrung his hands, saying, &ldquo;Well then, at
least parry the blow. Prepare for the time when they accuse
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra gazed about him in bewilderment. &ldquo;Then help
me. There in that writing-desk are all the letters of my family. Select
those of my father, which are perhaps the ones that may compromise me.
Read the signatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the bewildered and stupefied young man opened and
shut boxes, collected papers, read letters hurriedly, tearing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9594" href="#xd24e9594" name=
"xd24e9594">418</a>]</span>up some and laying others aside. He took
down some books and began to turn their leaves.</p>
<p class="par">Elias did the same, if not so excitedly, yet with equal
eagerness. But suddenly he paused, his eyes bulged, he turned the paper
in his hand over and over, then asked in a trembling voice:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was your family acquainted with Don Pedro
Eibarramendia?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I should say so!&rdquo; answered Ibarra, as he
opened a chest and took out a bundle of papers. &ldquo;He was my
great-grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your great-grandfather Don Pedro
Eibarramendia?&rdquo; again asked Elias with changed and livid
features.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Ibarra absently, &ldquo;we
shortened the surname; it was too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was he a Basque?&rdquo; demanded Elias,
approaching him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, a Basque&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; asked Ibarra in surprise.</p>
<p class="par">Clenching his fists and pressing them to his forehead,
Elias glared at Crisostomo, who recoiled when he saw the expression on
the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Do you know who Don Pedro Eibarramendia
was?&rdquo; he asked between his teeth. &ldquo;Don Pedro Eibarramendia
was the villain who falsely accused my grandfather and caused all our
misfortunes. I have sought for that name and God has revealed it to me!
Render me now an accounting for our misfortunes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias caught and shook the arm of Crisostomo, who gazed
at him in terror. In a voice that was bitter and trembling with hate,
he said, &ldquo;Look at me well, look at one who has suffered and you
live, you live, you have wealth, a home, reputation&mdash;you live, you
live!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Beside himself, he ran to a small collection of arms and
snatched up a dagger. But scarcely had he done so when he let it fall
again and stared like a madman at the motionless Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What was I about to do?&rdquo; he muttered,
fleeing from the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9619" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There in the dining-room Capitan Tiago, Linares,
and Aunt Isabel were at supper, so that even in the sala the rattling
of plates and dishes was plainly heard. Maria Clara had said that she
was not hungry and had seated herself at the piano in company with the
merry Sinang, who was murmuring mysterious words into her ear.
Meanwhile Padre Salvi paced nervously back and forth in the room.</p>
<p class="par">It was not, indeed, that the convalescent was not
hungry, no; but she was expecting the arrival of a certain person and
was taking advantage of this moment when her Argus was not present,
Linares&rsquo; supper-hour.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see how that specter will stay till
eight,&rdquo; murmured Sinang, indicating the curate. &ldquo;And at
eight <i>he</i> will come. The curate&rsquo;s in love with
Linares.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara gazed in consternation at her friend, who
went on heedlessly with her terrible chatter: &ldquo;Oh, I know why he
doesn&rsquo;t go, in spite of my hints&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t want to
burn up oil in the convento! Don&rsquo;t you know that since
you&rsquo;ve been sick the two lamps that he used to keep lighted he
has had put out? But look how he stares, and what a face!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that moment a clock in the house struck eight. The
curate shuddered and sat down in a corner.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here he comes!&rdquo; exclaimed Sinang, pinching
Maria Clara. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The church bell boomed out the hour of eight and all
rose to pray. Padre Salvi offered up a prayer in a weak <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9642" href="#xd24e9642" name=
"xd24e9642">420</a>]</span>and trembling voice, but as each was busy
with his own thoughts no one paid any attention to the priest&rsquo;s
agitation.</p>
<p class="par">Scarcely had the prayer ceased when Ibarra appeared. The
youth was in mourning not only in his attire but also in his face, to
such an extent that, on seeing him, Maria Clara arose and took a step
toward him to ask what the matter was. But at that instant the report
of firearms was heard. Ibarra stopped, his eyes rolled, he lost the
power of speech. The curate had concealed himself behind a post. More
shots, more reports were heard from the direction of the convento,
followed by cries and the sound of persons running. Capitan Tiago, Aunt
Isabel, and Linares rushed in pell-mell, crying, &ldquo;Tulisan!
Tulisan!&rdquo; Andeng followed, flourishing the gridiron as she ran
toward her foster-sister.</p>
<p class="par">Aunt Isabel fell on her knees weeping and reciting the
<i>Kyrie eleyson</i>; Capitan Tiago, pale and trembling, carried on his
fork a chicken-liver which he offered tearfully to the Virgin of
Antipolo; Linares with his mouth full of food was armed with a
case-knife; Sinang and Maria Clara were in each other&rsquo;s arms;
while the only one that remained motionless, as if petrified, was
Crisostomo, whose paleness was indescribable.</p>
<p class="par">The cries and sound of blows continued, windows were
closed noisily, the report of a gun was heard from time to time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Christie eleyson!</i> Santiago, let the
prophecy be fulfilled! Shut the windows!&rdquo; groaned Aunt
Isabel.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fifty big bombs and two thanksgiving
masses!&rdquo; responded Capitan Tiago. &ldquo;<i>Ora pro
nobis!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Gradually there prevailed a heavy silence which was soon
broken by the voice of the alferez, calling as he ran: &ldquo;Padre,
Padre Salvi, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Miserere!</i> The alferez is calling for
confession,&rdquo; cried Aunt Isabel. &ldquo;The alferez is
wounded?&rdquo; asked Linares hastily. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e9671" href="#xd24e9671" name=
"xd24e9671">421</a>]</span>&ldquo;Ah!!!&rdquo; Only then did he notice
that he had not yet swallowed what he had in his mouth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Padre, come here! There&rsquo;s nothing more to
fear!&rdquo; the alferez continued to call out.</p>
<p class="par">The pallid Fray Salvi at last concluded to venture out
from his hiding-place, and went down the stairs.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The outlaws have killed the alferez! Maria,
Sinang, go into your room and fasten the door! <i>Kyrie
eleyson!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra also turned toward the stairway, in spite of Aunt
Isabel&rsquo;s cries: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out, you haven&rsquo;t been
shriven, don&rsquo;t go out!&rdquo; The good old lady had been a
particular friend of his mother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">But Ibarra left the house. Everything seemed to reel
around him, the ground was unstable. His ears buzzed, his legs moved
heavily and irregularly. Waves of blood, lights and shadows chased one
another before his eyes, and in spite of the bright moonlight he
stumbled over the stones and blocks of wood in the vacant and deserted
street.</p>
<p class="par">Near the barracks he saw soldiers, with bayonets fixed,
who were talking among themselves so excitedly that he passed them
unnoticed. In the town hall were to be heard blows, cries, and curses,
with the voice of the alferez dominating everything: &ldquo;To the
stocks! Handcuff them! Shoot any one who moves! Sergeant, mount the
guard! Today no one shall walk about, not even God! Captain, this is no
time to go to sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra hastened his steps toward home, where his
servants were anxiously awaiting him. &ldquo;Saddle the best horse and
go to bed!&rdquo; he ordered them.</p>
<p class="par">Going into his study, he hastily packed a traveling-bag,
opened an iron safe, took out what money he found there and put it into
some sacks. Then he collected his jewels, took clown a portrait of
Maria Clara, armed himself with a dagger and two revolvers, and turned
toward a closet where he kept his instruments.</p>
<p class="par">At that moment three heavy knocks sounded on the door.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Ibarra in a gloomy tone.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9696" href=
"#xd24e9696" name="xd24e9696">422</a>]</span>&ldquo;Open, in the
King&rsquo;s name, open at once, or we&rsquo;ll break the door
down,&rdquo; answered an imperious voice in Spanish.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra looked toward the window, his eyes gleamed, and
he cocked his revolver. Then changing his mind, he put the weapons down
and went to open the door just as the servant appeared. Three guards
instantly seized him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Consider yourself a prisoner in the King&rsquo;s
name,&rdquo; said the sergeant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tell you over there. We&rsquo;re
forbidden to say.&rdquo; The youth reflected a moment and then, perhaps
not wishing that the soldiers should discover his preparations for
flight, picked up his hat, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at your service. I
suppose that it will only be for a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you promise not to try to escape, we
won&rsquo;t tie you the alferez grants this favor&mdash;but if you
run&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra went with them, leaving his servants in
consternation.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, what had become of Elias? Leaving the house
of Crisostomo, he had run like one crazed, without heeding where he was
going. He crossed the fields in violent agitation, he reached the
woods; he fled from the town, from the light&mdash;even the moon so
troubled him that he plunged into the mysterious shadows of the trees.
There, sometimes pausing, sometimes moving along unfrequented paths,
supporting himself on the hoary trunks or being entangled in the
undergrowth, he gazed toward the town, which, bathed in the light of
the moon, spread out before him on the plain along the shore of the
lake. Birds awakened from their sleep flew about, huge bats and owls
moved from branch to branch with strident cries and gazed at him with
their round eyes, but Elias neither heard nor heeded them. In his fancy
he was followed by the offended shades of his family, he saw on every
branch the gruesome basket containing Balat&rsquo;s gory head, as his
father had described it to him; at every tree he seemed to stumble over
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9712" href="#xd24e9712" name=
"xd24e9712">423</a>]</span>corpse of his grandmother; he imagined that
he saw the rotting skeleton of his dishonored grandfather swinging
among the shadows&mdash;and the skeleton and the corpse and the gory
head cried after him, &ldquo;Coward! Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Leaving the hill, Elias descended to the lake and ran
along the shore excitedly. There at a distance in the midst of the
waters, where the moonlight seemed to form a cloud, he thought he could
see a specter rise and soar the shade of his sister with her breast
bloody and her loose hair streaming about. He fell to his knees on the
sand and extending his arms cried out, &ldquo;You, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then with his gaze fixed on the cloud he arose slowly
and went forward into the water as if he were following some one. He
passed over the gentle slope that forms the bar and was soon far from
the shore. The water rose to his waist, but he plunged on like one
fascinated, following, ever following, the ghostly charmer. Now the
water covered his chest&mdash;a volley of rifle-shots sounded, the
vision disappeared, the youth returned to his senses. In the stillness
of the night and the greater density of the air the reports reached him
clearly and distinctly. He stopped to reflect and found himself in the
water&mdash;over the peaceful ripples of the lake he could still make
out the lights in the fishermen&rsquo;s huts.</p>
<p class="par">He returned to the shore and started toward the town,
but for what purpose he himself knew not. The streets appeared to be
deserted, the houses were closed, and even the dogs that were wont to
bark through the night had hidden themselves in fear. The silvery light
of the moon added to the sadness and loneliness.</p>
<p class="par">Fearful of meeting the civil-guards, he made his way
along through yards and gardens, in one of which he thought he could
discern two human figures, but he kept on his way, leaping over fences
and walls, until after great labor he reached the other end of the town
and went toward Crisostomo&rsquo;s house. In the doorway were the
servants, lamenting their master&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9724" href=
"#xd24e9724" name="xd24e9724">424</a>]</span>After learning about what
had occurred Elias pretended to go away, but really went around behind
the house, jumped over the wall, and crawled through a window into the
study where the candle that Ibarra had lighted was still burning. He
saw the books and papers and found the arms, the jewels, and the sacks
of money. Reconstructing in his imagination the scene that had taken
place there and seeing so many papers that might be of a compromising
nature, he decided to gather them up, throw them from the window, and
bury them.</p>
<p class="par">But, on glancing toward the street, he saw two guards
approaching, their bayonets and caps gleaming in the moonlight. With
them was the directorcillo. He made a sudden resolution: throwing the
papers and some clothing into a heap in the center of the room, he
poured over them the oil from a lamp and set fire to the whole. He was
hurriedly placing the arms in his belt when he caught sight of the
portrait of Maria Clara and hesitated a moment, then thrust it into one
of the sacks and with them in his hands leaped from the window into the
garden.</p>
<p class="par">It was time that he did so, too, for the guards were
forcing an entrance. &ldquo;Let us in to get your master&rsquo;s
papers!&rdquo; cried the directorcillo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you permission? If you haven&rsquo;t, you
won&rsquo;t get in,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered an old man.</p>
<p class="par">But the soldiers pushed him aside with the butts of
their rifles and ran up the stairway, just as a thick cloud of smoke
rolled through the house and long tongues of flame shot out from the
study, enveloping the doors and windows.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fire! Fire!&rdquo; was the cry, as each rushed to
save what he could. But the blaze had reached the little laboratory and
caught the inflammable materials there, so the guards had to retire.
The flames roared about, licking up everything in their way and cutting
off the passages. Vainly was water brought from the well and cries for
help <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9736" href="#xd24e9736" name=
"xd24e9736">425</a>]</span>raised, for the house was set apart from the
rest. The fire swept through all the rooms and sent toward the sky
thick spirals of smoke. Soon the whole structure was at the mercy of
the flames, fanned now by the wind, which in the heat grew stronger.
Some few rustics came up, but only to gaze on this great bonfire, the
end of that old building which had been so long respected by the
elements. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9738" href="#xd24e9738"

<h2 class="label">Chapter LVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Rumors and Beliefs</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Day dawned at last for the terrified town. The
streets near the barracks and the town hail were still deserted and
solitary, the houses showed no signs of life. Nevertheless, the wooden
panel of a window was pushed back noisily and a child&rsquo;s head was
stretched out and turned from side to side, gazing about in all
directions. At once, however, a smack indicated the contact of tanned
hide with the soft human article, so the child made a wry face, closed
its eyes, and disappeared. The window slammed shut.</p>
<p class="par">But an example had been set. That opening and shutting
of the window had no doubt been heard on all sides, for soon another
window opened slowly and there appeared cautiously the head of a
wrinkled and toothless old woman: it was the same Sister Put&eacute;
who had raised such a disturbance while Padre Damaso was preaching.
Children and old women are the representatives of curiosity in this
world: the former from a wish to know things and the latter from a
desire to recollect them.</p>
<p class="par">Apparently there was no one to apply a slipper to Sister
Put&eacute;, for she remained gazing out into the distance with
wrinkled eyebrows. Then she rinsed out her mouth, spat noisily, and
crossed herself. In the house opposite, another window was now timidly
opened to reveal Sister Rufa, she who did not wish to cheat or be
cheated. They stared at each other for a moment, smiled, made some
signs, and again crossed themselves.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s</i>, it seemed like a
thanksgiving mass, regular fireworks!&rdquo; commented Sister Rufa.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9757" href=
"#xd24e9757" name="xd24e9757">427</a>]</span>&ldquo;Since the town was
sacked by Balat, I&rsquo;ve never seen another night equal to
it,&rdquo; responded Sister Put&eacute;.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a lot of shots! They say that it was old
Pablo&rsquo;s band.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tulisanes? That can&rsquo;t be! They say that it
was the cuadrilleros against the civil-guards. That&rsquo;s why Don
Filipo has been arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Sanctus Deus!</i> They say that at least
fourteen were killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Other windows were now opened and more faces appeared to
exchange greetings and make comments. In the clear light, which
promised a bright day, soldiers could be seen in the distance, coming
and going confusedly like gray silhouettes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There goes one more corpse!&rdquo; was the
exclamation from a window.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One? I see two.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I&mdash;but really, can it be you don&rsquo;t
know what it was?&rdquo; asked a sly-featured individual.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, the cuadrilleros!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir, it was a mutiny in the
barracks!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What kind of mutiny? The curate against the
alferez?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, it was nothing of the kind,&rdquo; answered
the man who had asked the first question. &ldquo;It was the Chinamen
who have rebelled.&rdquo; With this he shut his window.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Chinamen!&rdquo; echoed all in great
astonishment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why not one of them is to be
seen!&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve probably killed them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I thought they were going to do something bad.
Yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I saw it myself. Last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; exclaimed Sister Rufa.
&ldquo;To get killed just before Christmas when they bring around their
presents! They should have waited until New Year&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Little by little the street awoke to life. Dogs,
chickens, pigs, and doves began the movement, and these animals
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9796" href="#xd24e9796" name=
"xd24e9796">428</a>]</span>were soon followed by some ragged urchins
who held fast to each other&rsquo;s arms as they timidly approached the
barracks. Then a few old women with handkerchiefs tied about their
heads and fastened under their chins appeared with thick rosaries in
their hands, pretending to be at their prayers so that the soldiers
would let them pass. When it was seen that one might walk about without
being shot at, the men began to come out with assumed airs of
indifference. First they limited their steps to the neighborhood of
their houses, caressing their game-cocks, then they extended their
stroll, stopping from time to time, until at last they stood in front
of the town hall.</p>
<p class="par">In a quarter of an hour other versions of the affair
were in circulation. Ibarra with his servants had tried to kidnap Maria
Clara, and Capitan Tiago had defended her, aided by the Civil Guard.
The number of killed was now not fourteen but thirty. Capitan Tiago was
wounded and would leave that very day with his family for Manila.</p>
<p class="par">The arrival of two cuadrilleros carrying a human form on
a covered stretcher and followed by a civil-guard produced a great
sensation. It was conjectured that they came from the convento, and,
from the shape of the feet, which were dangling over one end, some
guessed who the dead man might be, some one else a little distance away
told who it was; further on the corpse was multiplied and the mystery
of the Holy Trinity duplicated, later the miracle of the loaves and
fishes was repeated&mdash;and the dead were then thirty and eight.</p>
<p class="par">By half-past seven, when other guards arrived from
neighboring towns, the current version was clear and detailed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from the town hall, where I&rsquo;ve seen
Don Filipo and Don Crisostomo prisoners,&rdquo; a man told Sister
Put&eacute;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked with one of the cuadrilleros who
are on guard. Well, Bruno, the son of that fellow who was flogged to
death, confessed everything last night. As you know, Capitan Tiago is
going to marry his daughter to the young Spaniard, so Don Crisostomo in
his rage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9804" href="#xd24e9804"
name="xd24e9804">429</a>]</span>wanted to get revenge and tried to kill
all the Spaniards, even the curate. Last night they attacked the
barracks and the convento, but fortunately, by God&rsquo;s mercy, the
curate was in Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house. They say that a lot of them
escaped. The civil-guards burned Don Crisostomo&rsquo;s house down, and
if they hadn&rsquo;t arrested him first they would have burned him
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They burned the house down?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All the servants are under arrest. Look, you can
still see the smoke from here!&rdquo; answered the narrator,
approaching the window. &ldquo;Those who come from there tell of many
sad things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All looked toward the place indicated. A thin column of
smoke was still slowly rising toward the sky. All made comments, more
or less pitying, more or less accusing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Poor youth!&rdquo; exclaimed an old man,
Put&eacute;&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but look how he
didn&rsquo;t order a mass said for the soul of his father, who
undoubtedly needs it more than others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, woman, haven&rsquo;t you any
pity?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pity for the excommunicated? It&rsquo;s a sin to
take pity on the enemies of God, the curates say. Don&rsquo;t you
remember? In the cemetery he walked about as if he was in a
corral.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But a corral and the cemetery are alike,&rdquo;
replied the old man, &ldquo;only that into the former only one kind of
animal enters.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Sister Put&eacute;.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll still defend those whom God has clearly punished.
You&rsquo;ll see how they&rsquo;ll arrest you, too. You&rsquo;re
upholding a falling house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Her husband became silent before this argument.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the old lady, &ldquo;after
striking Padre Damaso there wasn&rsquo;t anything left for him to do
but to kill Padre Salvi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t deny that he was good when he
was a little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9832" href=
"#xd24e9832" name="xd24e9832">430</a>]</span>&ldquo;Yes, he was
good,&rdquo; replied the old woman, &ldquo;but he went to Spain. All
those that go to Spain become heretics, as the curates have
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband, seeing his
chance for a retort, &ldquo;and the curate, and all the curates, and
the Archbishop, and the Pope, and the Virgin&mdash;aren&rsquo;t they
from Spain? Are they also heretics? <i>Ab&aacute;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Happily for Sister Put&eacute; the arrival of a
maidservant running, all pale and terrified, cut short this
discussion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A man hanged in the next garden!&rdquo; she cried
breathlessly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A man hanged?&rdquo; exclaimed all in
stupefaction. The women crossed themselves. No one could move from his
place.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; went on the trembling servant;
&ldquo;I was going to pick peas&mdash;I looked into our
neighbor&rsquo;s garden to see if it was&mdash;I saw a man
swinging&mdash;I thought it was Teo, the servant who always gives
me&mdash;I went nearer to&mdash;pick the peas, and I saw that it
wasn&rsquo;t Teo, but a dead man. I ran and I ran and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see him,&rdquo; said the old man,
rising. &ldquo;Show us the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go!&rdquo; cried Sister
Put&eacute;, catching hold of his camisa. &ldquo;Something will happen
to you! Is he hanged? Then the worse for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let me see him, woman. You, Juan, go to the
barracks and report it. Perhaps he&rsquo;s not dead yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So he proceeded to the garden with the servant, who kept
behind him. The women, including even Sister Put&eacute; herself,
followed after, filled with fear and curiosity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There he is, sir,&rdquo; said the servant, as she
stopped and pointed with her finger.</p>
<p class="par">The committee paused at a respectful distance and
allowed the old man to go forward alone.</p>
<p class="par">A human body hanging from the branch of a santol tree
swung about gently in the breeze. The old man stared at it for a time
and saw that the legs and arms were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e9862" href="#xd24e9862" name="xd24e9862">431</a>]</span>stiff,
the clothing soiled, and the head doubled over.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t touch him until some officer of
the law arrives,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s already stiff,
he&rsquo;s been dead for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The women gradually moved closer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the fellow who lived in that little
house there. He came here two weeks ago. Look at the scar on his
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Ave Maria!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed some of the
women.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shall we pray for his soul?&rdquo; asked a young
woman, after she had finished staring and examining the body.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fool, heretic!&rdquo; scolded Sister Put&eacute;.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what Padre Damaso said? It&rsquo;s tempting
God to pray for one of the damned. Whoever commits suicide is
irrevocably damned and therefore he isn&rsquo;t buried in holy
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then she added, &ldquo;I knew that this man was coming
to a bad end; I never could find out how he lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I saw him twice talking with the senior
sacristan,&rdquo; observed a young woman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be to confess himself or to
order a mass!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Other neighbors came up until a large group surrounded
the corpse, which was still swinging about. After half an hour, an
alguazil and the directorcillo arrived with two cuadrilleros, who took
the body down and placed it on a stretcher.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;People are getting in a hurry to die,&rdquo;
remarked the directorcillo with a smile, as he took a pen from behind
his ear.</p>
<p class="par">He made captious inquiries, and took down the statement
of the maidservant, whom he tried to confuse, now looking at her
fiercely, now threatening her, now attributing to her things that she
had not said, so much so that she, thinking that she would have to go
to jail, began to cry and wound up by declaring that she wasn&rsquo;t
looking for peas but and she called Teo as a witness.</p>
<p class="par">While this was taking place, a rustic in a wide salakot
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9894" href="#xd24e9894" name=
"xd24e9894">432</a>]</span>with a big bandage on his neck was examining
the corpse and the rope. The face was not more livid than the rest of
the body, two scratches and two red spots were to be seen above the
noose, the strands of the rope were white and had no blood on them. The
curious rustic carefully examined the camisa and pantaloons, and
noticed that they were very dusty and freshly torn in some parts. But
what most caught his attention were the seeds of <i>amores-secos</i>
that were sticking on the camisa even up to the collar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; the directorcillo
asked him. &ldquo;I was looking, sir, to see if I could recognize
him,&rdquo; stammered the rustic, partly uncovering, but in such a way
that his salakot fell lower.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you heard that it&rsquo;s a
certain Lucas? Were you asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The crowd laughed, while the abashed rustic muttered a
few words and moved away slowly with his head down.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here, where you going?&rdquo; cried the old man
after him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way out. That&rsquo;s the
way to the dead man&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s still asleep,&rdquo; remarked
the directorcillo facetiously. &ldquo;Better pour some water over
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Amid the laughter of the bystanders the rustic left the
place where he had played such a ridiculous part and went toward the
church. In the sacristy he asked for the senior sacristan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still asleep,&rdquo; was the rough
answer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that the convento was assaulted
last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wait till he wakes up.&rdquo;
This with a stupid stare at the sacristans, such as is common to
persons who are used to rough treatment.</p>
<p class="par">In a corner which was still in shadow the one-eyed
senior sacristan lay asleep in a big chair. His spectacles were placed
on his forehead amid long locks of hair, while his thin, squalid chest,
which was bare, rose and fell regularly.</p>
<p class="par">The rustic took a seat near by, as if to wait patiently,
but he dropped a piece of money and started to look for it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9922" href="#xd24e9922" name=
"xd24e9922">433</a>]</span>with the aid of a candle under the senior
sacristan&rsquo;s chair. He noticed seeds of <i>amores-secos</i> on the
pantaloons and on the cuffs of the sleeper&rsquo;s camisa. The latter
awoke, rubbed his one good eye, and began to scold the rustic with
great ill-humor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wanted to order a mass, sir,&rdquo; was the
reply in a tone of excuse.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The masses are already over,&rdquo; said the
sacristan, sweetening his tone a little at this. &ldquo;If you want it
for tomorrow&mdash;is it for the souls in purgatory?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the rustic, handing him
a peso.</p>
<p class="par">Then gazing fixedly at the single eye, he added,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for a person who&rsquo;s going to die
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Hereupon he left the sacristy. &ldquo;I could have
caught him last night!&rdquo; he sighed, as he took off the bandage and
stood erect to recover the face and form of Elias. <span class=

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="par first">Mi gozo en un pozo.</p>
</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Guards with forbidding mien paced to and fro in
front of the door of the town hall, threatening with their rifle-butts
the bold urchins who rose on tiptoe or climbed up on one another to see
through the bars.</p>
<p class="par">The hall itself did not present that agreeable aspect it
wore when the program of the fiesta was under discussion&mdash;now it
was gloomy and rather ominous. The civil-guards and cuadrilleros who
occupied it scarcely spoke and then with few words in low tones. At the
table the directorcillo, two clerks, and several soldiers were rustling
papers, while the alferez strode from one side to the other, at times
gazing fiercely toward the door: prouder Themistocles could not have
appeared in the Olympic games after the battle of Salamis. Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion yawned in a corner, exhibiting a dirty mouth and jagged
teeth, while she fixed her cold, sinister gaze on the door of the jail,
which was covered with indecent drawings. She had succeeded in
persuading her husband, whose victory had made him amiable, to let her
witness the inquiry and perhaps the accompanying tortures. The hyena
smelt the carrion and licked herself, wearied by the delay.</p>
<p class="par">The gobernadorcillo was very compunctious. His seat,
that large chair placed under his Majesty&rsquo;s portrait, was vacant,
being apparently intended for some one else. About nine o&rsquo;clock
the curate arrived, pale and scowling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t kept yourself
waiting!&rdquo; the alferez greeted him.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9956" href=
"#xd24e9956" name="xd24e9956">435</a>]</span>&ldquo;I should prefer not
to be present,&rdquo; replied Padre Salvi in a low voice, paying no
heed to the bitter tone of the alferez. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As no one else has come to fill the place, I
judged that your presence&mdash;You know that they leave this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Young Ibarra and the teniente-mayor?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez pointed toward the jail. &ldquo;There are
eight there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bruno died at midnight, but his
statement is on record.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The curate saluted Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, who
responded with a yawn, and took his seat in the big chair under his
Majesty&rsquo;s portrait. &ldquo;Let us begin,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bring out those two who are in the stocks,&rdquo;
ordered the alferez in a tone that he tried to make as terrible as
possible. Then turning to the curate he added with a change of tone,
&ldquo;They are fastened in by skipping two holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For the benefit of those who are not informed about
these instruments of torture, we will say that the stocks are one of
the most harmless. The holes in which the offender&rsquo;s legs are
placed are a little more or less than a foot apart; by skipping two
holes, the prisoner finds himself in a rather forced position with
peculiar inconvenience to his ankles and a distance of about a yard
between his lower extremities. It does not kill instantaneously, as may
well be imagined.</p>
<p class="par">The jailer, followed by four soldiers, pushed back the
bolt and opened the door. A nauseating odor and currents of thick, damp
air escaped from the darkness within at the same time that laments and
sighs were heard. A soldier struck a match, but the flame was choked in
such a foul atmosphere, and they had to wait until the air became
fresher.</p>
<p class="par">In the dim light of the candle several human forms
became vaguely outlined: men hugging their knees or hiding their heads
between them, some lying face downward, some standing, and some turned
toward the wall. A blow <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e9975" href=
"#xd24e9975" name="xd24e9975">436</a>]</span>and a creak were heard,
accompanied by curses&mdash;the stocks were opened, Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion bent forward with the muscles of her neck swelling and her
bulging eyes fixed on the half-opened door.</p>
<p class="par">A wretched figure, Tarsilo, Bruno&rsquo;s brother, came
out between two soldiers. On his wrists were handcuffs and his clothing
was in shreds, revealing quite a muscular body. He turned his eyes
insolently on the alferez&rsquo;s woman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is the one who defended himself with the
most courage and told his companions to run,&rdquo; said the alferez to
Padre Salvi.</p>
<p class="par">Behind him came another of miserable aspect, moaning and
weeping like a child. He limped along exposing pantaloons spotted with
blood. &ldquo;Mercy, sir, mercy! I&rsquo;ll not go back into the
yard,&rdquo; he whimpered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rogue,&rdquo; observed the alferez
to the curate. &ldquo;He tried to run, but he was wounded in the thigh.
These are the only two that we took alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; the alferez asked
Tarsilo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tarsilo Alasigan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did Don Crisostomo promise you for attacking
the barracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Crisostomo never had anything to do with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it! That&rsquo;s why you tried
to surprise us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken. You beat our father to
death and we were avenging him, nothing more. Look for your two
associates.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez gazed at the sergeant in surprise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re over there in the gully where we
threw them yesterday and where they&rsquo;ll rot. Now kill me,
you&rsquo;ll not learn anything more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">General surprise and silence, broken by the alferez.
&ldquo;You are going to tell who your other accomplices are,&rdquo; he
threatened, flourishing a rattan whip.</p>
<p class="par">A smile of disdain curled the prisoner&rsquo;s lips. The
alferez consulted with the curate in a low tone for a few moments,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10006" href="#xd24e10006" name=
"xd24e10006">437</a>]</span>then turned to the soldiers. &ldquo;Take
him out where the corpses are,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p class="par">On a cart in a corner of the yard were heaped five
corpses, partly covered with a filthy piece of torn matting. A soldier
walked about near them, spitting at every moment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo; asked the alferez,
lifting up the matting.</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo did not answer. He saw the corpse of the
madwoman&rsquo;s husband with two others: that of his brother, slashed
with bayonet-thrusts, and that of Lucas with the halter still around
his neck. His look became somber and a sigh seemed to escape from his
breast.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo; he was again asked, but
he still remained silent.</p>
<p class="par">The air hissed and the rattan cut his shoulders. He
shuddered, his muscles contracted. The blows were redoubled, but he
remained unmoved.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whip him until he bursts or talks!&rdquo; cried
the exasperated alferez.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Talk now,&rdquo; the directorcillo advised him.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill you anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They led him back into the hall where the other
prisoner, with chattering teeth and quaking limbs, was calling upon the
saints.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know this fellow?&rdquo; asked Padre
Salvi.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is the first time that I&rsquo;ve ever seen
him,&rdquo; replied Tarsilo with a look of pity at the other.</p>
<p class="par">The alferez struck him with his fist and kicked him.
&ldquo;Tie him to the bench!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Without taking off the handcuffs, which were covered
with blood, they tied him to a wooden bench. The wretched boy looked
about him as if seeking something and noticed Do&ntilde;a Consolacion,
at sight of whom he smiled sardonically. In surprise the bystanders
followed his glance and saw the se&ntilde;ora, who was lightly gnawing
at her lips.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen an uglier woman!&rdquo;
exclaimed Tarsilo in the midst of a general silence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather lie down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10035" href=
"#xd24e10035" name="xd24e10035">438</a>]</span>on a bench as I do now
than at her side as the alferez does.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Muse turned pale.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to flog me to death,
Se&ntilde;or Alferez,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but tonight your woman
will revenge me by embracing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gag him!&rdquo; yelled the furious alferez,
trembling with wrath.</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo seemed to have desired the gag, for after it was
put in place his eyes gleamed with satisfaction. At a signal from the
alferez, a guard armed with a rattan whip began his gruesome task.
Tarsilo&rsquo;s whole body contracted, and a stifled, prolonged cry
escaped from him in spite of the piece of cloth which covered his
mouth. His head drooped and his clothes became stained with blood.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Salvi, pallid and with wandering looks, arose
laboriously, made a sign with his hand, and left the hall with
faltering steps. In the street he saw a young woman leaning with her
shoulders against the wall, rigid, motionless, listening attentively,
staring into space, her clenched hands stretched out along the wall.
The sun beat down upon her fiercely. She seemed to be breathlessly
counting those dry, dull strokes and those heartrending groans. It was
Tarsilo&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, the scene in the hall continued. The wretched
boy, overcome with pain, silently waited for his executioners to become
weary. At last the panting soldier let his arm fall, and the alferez,
pale with anger and astonishment, made a sign for them to untie him.
Do&ntilde;a Consolacion then arose and murmured a few words into the
ear of her husband, who nodded his head in understanding.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the well with him!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p class="par">The Filipinos know what this means: in Tagalog they call
it <i>timba&iacute;n</i>. We do not know who invented this procedure,
but we judge that it must be quite ancient. Truth at the bottom of a
well may perhaps be a sarcastic interpretation.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10058" href=
"#xd24e10058" name="xd24e10058">439</a>]</span>In the center of the
yard rose the picturesque curb of a well, roughly fashioned from living
rock. A rude apparatus of bamboo in the form of a well-sweep served for
drawing up the thick, slimy, foul-smelling water. Broken pieces of
pottery, manure, and other refuse were collected there, since this well
was like the jail, being the place for what society rejected or found
useless, and any object that fell into it, however good it might have
been, was then a thing lost. Yet it was never closed up, and even at
times the prisoners were condemned to go down and deepen it, not
because there was any thought of getting anything useful out of such
punishment, but because of the difficulties the work offered. A
prisoner who once went down there would contract a fever from which he
would surely die.</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo gazed upon all the preparations of the soldiers
with a fixed look. He was pale, and his lips trembled or murmured a
prayer. The haughtiness of his desperation seemed to have disappeared
or, at least, to have weakened. Several times he bent his stiff neck
and fixed his gaze on the ground as though resigned to his sufferings.
They led him to the well-curb, followed by the smiling Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion. In his misery he cast a glance of envy toward the heap of
corpses and a sigh escaped from his breast.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Talk now,&rdquo; the directorcillo again advised
him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hang you anyhow. You&rsquo;ll at least die
without suffering so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come out of this only to die,&rdquo;
added a cuadrillero.</p>
<p class="par">They took away the gag and hung him up by his feet, for
he must go down head foremost and remain some time under the water,
just as the bucket does, only that the man is left a longer time. While
the alferez was gone to look for a watch to count the minutes, Tarsilo
hung with his long hair streaming down and his eyes half closed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you are Christians, if you have any
heart,&rdquo; he begged in a low voice, &ldquo;let me down quickly or
make my head strike against the sides so that I&rsquo;ll die. God will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10071" href="#xd24e10071" name=
"xd24e10071">440</a>]</span>reward you for this good deed&mdash;perhaps
some day you may be as I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The alferez returned, watch in hand, to superintend the
lowering.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Slowly, slowly!&rdquo; cried Do&ntilde;a
Consolacion, as she kept her gaze fixed on the wretch. &ldquo;Be
careful!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The well-sweep moved gently downwards. Tarsilo rubbed
against the jutting stones and filthy weeds that grew in the crevices.
Then the sweep stopped while the alferez counted the seconds.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Lift him up!&rdquo; he ordered, at the end of a
half-minute. The silvery and harmonious tinkling of the drops of water
falling back indicated the prisoner&rsquo;s return to the light. Now
that the sweep was heavier he rose rapidly. Pieces of stone and pebbles
torn from the walls fell noisily. His forehead and hair smeared with
filthy slime, his face covered with cuts and bruises, his body wet and
dripping, he appeared to the eyes of the silent crowd. The wind made
him shiver with cold.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Will you talk?&rdquo; he was asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take care of my sister,&rdquo; murmured the
unhappy boy as he gazed beseechingly toward one of the
cuadrilleros.</p>
<p class="par">The bamboo sweep again creaked, and the condemned boy
once more disappeared. Do&ntilde;a Consolacion observed that the water
remained quiet. The alferez counted a minute.</p>
<p class="par">When Tarsilo again came up his features were contracted
and livid. With his bloodshot eyes wide open, he looked at the
bystanders.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you going to talk?&rdquo; the alferez again
demanded in dismay.</p>
<p class="par">Tarsilo shook his head, and they again lowered him. His
eyelids were closing as the pupils continued to stare at the sky where
the fleecy clouds floated; he doubled back his neck so that he might
still see the light of day, but all too soon he had to go down into the
water, and that foul curtain shut out the sight of the world from him
forever.</p>
<p class="par">A minute passed. The watchful Muse saw large bubbles
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10096" href="#xd24e10096" name=
"xd24e10096">441</a>]</span>rise to the surface of the water.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thirsty,&rdquo; she commented with a laugh. The water
again became still.</p>
<p class="par">This time the alferez did not give the signal for a
minute and a half. Tarsilo&rsquo;s features were now no longer
contracted. The half-raised lids left the whites of his eyes showing,
from his mouth poured muddy water streaked with blood, but his body did
not tremble in the chill breeze.</p>
<p class="par">Pale and terrified, the silent bystanders gazed at one
another. The alferez made a sign that they should take the body down,
and then moved away thoughtfully. Do&ntilde;a Consolation applied the
lighted end of her cigar to the bare legs, but the flesh did not twitch
and the fire was extinguished.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He strangled himself,&rdquo; murmured a
cuadrillero. &ldquo;Look how he turned his tongue back as if trying to
swallow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The other prisoner, who had watched this scene, sweating
and trembling, now stared like a lunatic in all directions. The alferez
ordered the directorcillo to question him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir, sir,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell everything you want me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good! Let&rsquo;s see, what&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Andong,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10112src"
href="#xd24e10112" name="xd24e10112src">1</a> sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">
&ldquo;Bernardo&mdash;Leonardo&mdash;Ricardo&mdash;Eduardo&mdash;Gerardo&mdash;or
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Andong, sir!&rdquo; repeated the imbecile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Put it down Bernardo, or whatever it may
be,&rdquo; dictated the alferez.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Surname?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The man gazed at him in terror.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What name have you that is added to the name
Andong?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, sir! Andong the Witless, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The bystander&rsquo;s could not restrain a smile. Even
the alferez paused in his pacing about.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10136" href=
"#xd24e10136" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Pruner of coconut trees, sir, and servant of my
mother-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who ordered you to attack the
barracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No one, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What, no one? Don&rsquo;t lie about it or into
the well you go! Who ordered you? Say truly!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Truly, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you who ordered you to start the
revolution?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What revolution, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This one, for you were in the yard by the
barracks last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Andong, blushing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s guilty of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My mother-in-law, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Surprise and laughter followed these words. The alferez
stopped and stared not unkindly at the wretch, who, thinking that his
words had produced a good effect, went on with more spirit: &ldquo;Yes,
sir, my mother-in-law doesn&rsquo;t give me anything to eat but what is
rotten and unfit, so last night when I came by here with my belly
aching I saw the yard of the barracks near and I said to myself,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s night-time, no one will see me.&rsquo; I went
in&mdash;and then many shots sounded&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A blow from the rattan cut his speech short.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the jail,&rdquo; ordered the alferez.
&ldquo;This afternoon, to the capital!&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter LVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Accursed</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Soon the news spread through the town that the
prisoners were about to set out. At first it was heard with terror;
afterward came the weeping and wailing. The families of the prisoners
ran about in distraction, going from the convento to the barracks, from
the barracks to the town hall, and finding no consolation anywhere,
filled the air with cries and groans. The curate had shut himself up on
a plea of illness; the alferez had increased the guards, who received
the supplicating women with the butts of their rifles; the
gobernadorcillo, at best a useless creature, seemed to be more foolish
and more useless than ever. In front of the jail the women who still
had strength enough ran to and fro, while those who had not sat down on
the ground and called upon the names of their beloved.</p>
<p class="par">Although the sun beat down fiercely, not one of these
unfortunates thought of going away. Doray, the erstwhile merry and
happy wife of Don Filipo, wandered about dejectedly, carrying in her
arms their infant son, both weeping. To the advice of friends that she
go back home to avoid exposing her baby to an attack of fever, the
disconsolate woman replied, &ldquo;Why should he live, if he
isn&rsquo;t going to have a father to rear him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your husband is innocent. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, after we&rsquo;re all dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitana Tinay wept and called upon her son Antonio. The
courageous Capitana Maria gazed silently toward the small grating
behind which were her twin-boys, her only sons.</p>
<p class="par">There was present also the mother-in-law of the pruner
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10190" href="#xd24e10190" name=
"xd24e10190">444</a>]</span>of coco-palms, but she was not weeping;
instead, she paced back and forth, gesticulating with uplifted arms,
and haranguing the crowd: &ldquo;Did you ever see anything like it? To
arrest my Andong, to shoot at him, to put him in the stocks, to take
him to the capital, and only because&mdash;because he had a new pair of
pantaloons! This calls for vengeance! The civil-guards are committing
abuses! I swear that if I ever again catch one of them in my garden, as
has often happened, I&rsquo;ll chop him up, I&rsquo;ll chop him up, or
else&mdash;let him try to chop me up!&rdquo; Few persons, however,
joined in the protests of the Mussulmanish mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don Crisostomo is to blame for all this,&rdquo;
sighed a woman.</p>
<p class="par">The schoolmaster was also in the crowd, wandering about
bewildered. &Ntilde;or Juan did not rub his hands, nor was he carrying
his rule and plumb-bob; he was dressed in black, for he had heard the
bad news and, true to his habit of looking upon the future as already
assured, was in mourning for Ibarra&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p class="par">At two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon an open cart drawn
by two oxen stopped in front of the town hall. This was at once set
upon by the people, who attempted to unhitch the oxen and destroy it.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; said Capitana Maria. &ldquo;Do you
want to make them walk?&rdquo; This consideration acted as a restraint
on the prisoners&rsquo; relatives.</p>
<p class="par">Twenty soldiers came out and surrounded the cart; then
the prisoners appeared. The first was Don Filipo, bound. He greeted his
wife smilingly, but Doray broke out into bitter weeping and two guards
had difficulty in preventing her from embracing her husband. Antonio,
the son of Capitana Tinay, appeared crying like a baby, which only
added to the lamentations of his family. The witless Andong broke out
into tears at sight of his mother-in-law, the cause of his misfortune.
Albino, the quondam theological student, was also bound, as were
Capitana Maria&rsquo;s twins. All three were grave and serious. The
last to come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10201" href=
"#xd24e10201" name="xd24e10201">445</a>]</span>out was Ibarra, unbound,
but conducted between two guards. The pallid youth looked about him for
a friendly face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s to blame!&rdquo;
cried many voices. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s to blame and he goes
loose!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My son-in-law hasn&rsquo;t done anything and
he&rsquo;s got handcuffs on!&rdquo; Ibarra turned to the guards.
&ldquo;Bind me, and bind me well, elbow to elbow,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any order.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bind me!&rdquo; And the soldiers obeyed.</p>
<p class="par">The alferez appeared on horseback, armed to the teeth,
ten or fifteen more soldiers following him.</p>
<p class="par">Each prisoner had his family there to pray for him, to
weep for him, to bestow on him the most endearing names&mdash;all save
Ibarra, who had no one, even &Ntilde;or Juan and the schoolmaster
having disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look what you&rsquo;ve done to my husband and my
son!&rdquo; Doray cried to him. &ldquo;Look at my poor son!
You&rsquo;ve robbed him of his father!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the sorrow of the families was converted into anger
toward the young man, who was accused of having started the trouble.
The alferez gave the order to set out.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a coward!&rdquo; the mother-in-law
of Andong cried after Ibarra. &ldquo;While others were fighting for
you, you hid yourself, coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May you be accursed!&rdquo; exclaimed an old man,
running along beside him. &ldquo;Accursed be the gold amassed by your
family to disturb our peace! Accursed! Accursed!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May they hang you, heretic!&rdquo; cried a
relative of Albino&rsquo;s. Unable to restrain himself, he caught up a
stone and threw it at the youth.</p>
<p class="par">This example was quickly followed, and a rain of dirt
and stones fell on the wretched young man. Without anger or complaint,
impassively he bore the righteous vengeance of so many suffering
hearts. This was the parting, the farewell, offered to him by the
people among whom were all his affections. With bowed head, he was
perhaps thinking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10228" href=
"#xd24e10228" name="xd24e10228">446</a>]</span>of a man whipped through
the streets of Manila, of an old woman falling dead at the sight of her
son&rsquo;s head; perhaps Elias&rsquo;s history was passing before his
eyes.</p>
<p class="par">The alferez found it necessary to drive the crowd back,
but the stone-throwing and the insults did not cease. One mother alone
did not wreak vengeance on him for her sorrows, Capitana Maria.
Motionless, with lips contracted and eyes full of silent tears, she saw
her two sons move away; her firmness, her dumb grief surpassed that of
the fabled Niobe.</p>
<p class="par">So the procession moved on. Of the persons who appeared
at the few open windows those who showed most pity for the youth were
the indifferent and the curious. All his friends had hidden themselves,
even Capitan Basilio himself, who forbade his daughter Sinang to
weep.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra saw the smoking ruins of his house&mdash;the home
of his fathers, where he was born, where clustered the fondest
recollections of his childhood and his youth. Tears long repressed
started into his eyes, and he bowed his head and wept without having
the consolation of being able to hide his grief, tied as he was, nor of
having any one in whom his sorrow awoke compassion. Now he had neither
country, nor home, nor love, nor friends, nor future!</p>
<p class="par">From a slight elevation a man gazed upon the sad
procession. He was an old man, pale and emaciated, wrapped in a woolen
blanket, supporting himself with difficulty on a staff. It was the old
Sage, Tasio, who, on hearing of the event, had left his bed to be
present, but his strength had not been sufficient to carry him to the
town hall. The old man followed the cart with his gaze until it
disappeared in the distance and then remained for some time afterward
with his head bowed, deep in thought. Then he stood up and laboriously
made his way toward his house, pausing to rest at every step. On the
following day some herdsmen found him dead on the very threshold of his
solitary home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10238" href=

<p class="par first">Secretly the telegraph transmitted the report to
Manila, and thirty-six hours later the newspapers commented on it with
great mystery and not a few dark hints&mdash;augmented, corrected, or
mutilated by the censor. In the meantime, private reports, emanating
from the convents, were the first to gain secret currency from mouth to
mouth, to the great terror of those who heard them. The fact, distorted
in a thousand ways, was believed with greater or less ease according to
whether it was flattering or worked contrary to the passions and ways
of thinking of each hearer.</p>
<p class="par">Without public tranquillity seeming disturbed, at least
outwardly, yet the peace of mind of each home was whirled about like
the water in a pond: while the surface appears smooth and clear, in the
depths the silent fishes swarm, dive about, and chase one another. For
one part of the population crosses, decorations, epaulets, offices,
prestige, power, importance, dignities began to whirl about like
butterflies in a golden atmosphere. For the other part a dark cloud
arose on the horizon, projecting from its gray depths, like black
silhouettes, bars, chains, and even the fateful gibbet. In the air
there seemed to be heard investigations, condemnations, and the cries
from the torture chamber; Marianas<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10248src"
href="#xd24e10248" name="xd24e10248src">1</a> and Bagumbayan presented
themselves wrapped in a torn and bloody veil, fishers and fished
confused. Fate pictured the event to the imaginations of the Manilans
like certain Chinese fans&mdash;one side painted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10251" href="#xd24e10251" name=
"xd24e10251">448</a>]</span>black, the other gilded with bright-colored
birds and flowers.</p>
<p class="par">In the convents the greatest excitement prevailed.
Carriages were harnessed, the Provincials exchanged visits and held
secret conferences; they presented themselves in the palaces to offer
their aid to <i>the government in its perilous crisis</i>. Again there
was talk of comets and omens.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>A Te Deum! A Te Deum!</i>&rdquo; cried a friar
in one convent. &ldquo;This time let no one be absent from the chorus!
It&rsquo;s no small mercy from God to make it clear just now,
especially in these hopeless times, how much we are worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The little general <i>Mal-Aguero</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10267src" href="#xd24e10267" name=
"xd24e10267src">2</a> can gnaw his lips over this lesson,&rdquo;
responded another.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What would have become of him if not for the
religious corporations?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And to celebrate the fiesta better, serve notice
on the cook and the refectioner. <i>Gaudeamus</i> for three
days!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;Viva Salvi!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In another convent they talked differently.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see, now, that fellow is a pupil of the
Jesuits. The filibusters come from the Ateneo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the anti-friars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I told you so. The Jesuits are ruining the
country, they&rsquo;re corrupting the youth, but they are tolerated
because they trace a few scrawls on a piece of paper when there is an
earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And God knows how they are made!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t contradict them. When
everything is shaking and moving about, who draws diagrams? Nothing,
Padre Secchi&mdash;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10292src" href=

<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10296" href=
"#xd24e10296" name="xd24e10296">449</a>]</span>And they smiled with
sovereign disdain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what about the weather forecasts and the
typhoons?&rdquo; asked another ironically. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they
divine?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Any fisherman foretells them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When he who governs is a fool&mdash;tell me how
your head is and I&rsquo;ll tell you how your foot is! But you&rsquo;ll
see if the friends favor one another. The newspapers very nearly ask a
miter for Padre Salvi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to get it! He&rsquo;ll lick it
right up!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why not! Nowadays they grant one for anything
whatsoever. I know of a fellow who got one for less. He wrote a cheap
little work demonstrating that the Indians are not capable of being
anything but mechanics. Pshaw, old-fogyisms!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! So much favoritism injures
Religion!&rdquo; exclaimed another. &ldquo;If the miters only had eyes
and could see what heads they were upon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If the miters were natural objects,&rdquo; added
another in a nasal tone, &ldquo;<i>Natura abhorrer
vacuum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they grab for them, their
emptiness attracts!&rdquo; responded another.</p>
<p class="par">These and many more things were said in the convents,
but we will spare our reader other comments of a political,
metaphysical, or piquant nature and conduct him to a private house. As
we have few acquaintances in Manila, let us enter the home of Capitan
Tinong, the polite individual whom we saw so profusely inviting Ibarra
to honor him with a visit.</p>
<p class="par">In the rich and spacious sala of his Tondo house,
Capitan Tinong was seated in a wide armchair, rubbing his hands in a
gesture of despair over his face and the nape of his neck, while his
wife, Capitana Tinchang, was weeping and preaching to him. From the
corner their two daughters listened silently and stupidly, yet greatly
affected.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ay, Virgin of Antipolo!&rdquo; cried the woman.
&ldquo;Ay, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10326" href="#xd24e10326"

<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; responded the elder of the
daughters.</p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t tell me anything,&rdquo;
Capitan Tinong dared to answer tearfully. &ldquo;On the contrary, you
told me that I was doing well to frequent Capitan Tiago&rsquo;s house
and cultivate friendship with him, because he&rsquo;s rich&mdash;and
you told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

listened to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re throwing the blame on

&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that I had done well to invite him to
dine with us, because he was wealthy? Didn&rsquo;t you say that we
ought to have friends only among the wealthy?

<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that I told you so,

You did nothing but sing his praises: <i>Don Ibarra</i> here, <i>Don

I didn&rsquo;t advise you to hunt him up and talk to him at that

<p class="par">&ldquo;Did I know that he was to be there,

<p class="par">&ldquo;But you ought to have known it!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;But, Tinchang, it was the first time that I ever

<p class="par">&ldquo;Well then, you ought to have known him before and

terrible look.</p>
<p class="par">To this Capitan Tinong did not know what to reply.
Capitana Tinchang, however, was not satisfied with this victory, but
wished to silence him completely. So she approached him with clenched
fists. &ldquo;Is this what I&rsquo;ve worked for, year after year,
toiling and saving, that you by your stupidity may throw away the
fruits of my labor?&rdquo; she scolded. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ll come
to deport you, they&rsquo;ll take away all our property, just as they
did from the wife of&mdash;Oh, if I were a man, if I were a

<p class="par">Seeing that her husband bowed his head, she again fell
to sobbing, but still repeating, &ldquo;Ay, if I were a man, if I were
a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, if you were a man,&rdquo; the provoked
husband at length asked, &ldquo;what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What would I do? Well&mdash;well&mdash;well, this
very minute I&rsquo;d go to the Captain-General and offer to fight
against the rebels, this very minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you seen what the <i>Diario</i>
says? Read it: &lsquo;The vile and infamous treason has been suppressed
with energy, strength, and vigor, and soon the rebellious enemies of
the Fatherland and their accomplices will feel all the weight and
severity of the law.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you see it? There isn&rsquo;t
any more rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter! You ought to offer
yourself as they did in &rsquo;72;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10409src"

to him and slapped her hand over his mouth. &ldquo;Shut up! Are you
saying that name so that they may garrote you tomorrow on Bagumbayan?
Don&rsquo;t you know that to pronounce it is enough to get yourself
condemned without trial? Keep quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">However Capitan Tinong may have felt about obeying her,
he could hardly have done otherwise, for she had his mouth covered with
both her hands, pressing his little head against the back of the chair,
so that the poor fellow might have been smothered to death had not a
new personage appeared on the scene. This was their cousin, Don
Primitivo, who had memorized the &ldquo;Amat,&rdquo; a man of some
forty years, plump, big-paunched, and elegantly dressed.</p>

nearer to him to hang upon the advice from his lips, as at one time the

Spanish or Tagalog. Give us some advice.&rdquo;</p>

bookcases, to tear up papers, books, and letters. Soon a big fire was
burning in the kitchen. Old shotguns were smashed with axes, rusty
revolvers were thrown away. The maidservant who wanted to keep the
barrel of one for a blowpipe received a reprimand:</p>

<p class="par">Harmless books, written by simple authors, were burned;
not even the most innocent work escaped. Cousin Primitivo was right:
the righteous suffer for the sinners.</p>
<p class="par">Four or five hours later, at a pretentious reception in
the Walled City, current events were being commented upon. There were
present a lot of old women and maidens of marriageable age, the wives
and daughters of government employees, dressed in loose gowns, fanning
themselves and yawning. Among the men, who, like the women, showed in
their faces their education and origin, was an elderly gentleman, small
and one-armed, whom the others treated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e10587" href="#xd24e10587" name="xd24e10587">456</a>]</span>with
great respect. He himself maintained a disdainful silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To tell the truth, formerly I couldn&rsquo;t
endure the friars and the civil-guards, they&rsquo;re so rude,&rdquo;
said a corpulent dame, &ldquo;but now that I see their usefulness and
their services, I would almost marry any one of them gladly. I&rsquo;m
a patriot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say!&rdquo; added a thin
lady. &ldquo;What a pity that we haven&rsquo;t our former governor. He
would leave the country as clean as a platter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And the whole race of filibusters would be
exterminated!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they say that there are still a lot
of islands to be populated? Why don&rsquo;t they deport all these crazy
Indians to them? If I were the Captain-General&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;oras,&rdquo; interrupted the one-armed
individual, &ldquo;the Captain-General knows his duty. As I&rsquo;ve
heard, he&rsquo;s very much irritated, for he had heaped favors on that
Ibarra.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Heaped favors on him!&rdquo; echoed the thin
lady, fanning herself furiously. &ldquo;Look how ungrateful these
Indians are! Is it possible to treat them as if they were human beings?
<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;ve heard?&rdquo; asked a
military official.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Reputable persons,&rdquo; replied the officer in
the midst of a profound silence, &ldquo;state that this agitation for
building a schoolhouse was a pure fairy tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i> Just see that!&rdquo; the
se&ntilde;oras exclaimed, already believing in the trick.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The school was a pretext. What he wanted to build
was a fort from which he could safely defend himself when we should
come to attack him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What infamy! Only an Indian is capable of such
cowardly thoughts,&rdquo; exclaimed the fat lady. &ldquo;If I were the

would soon see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say!&rdquo; exclaimed the
thin lady, turning to the one-armed man. &ldquo;Arrest all the little
lawyers, priestlings, merchants, and without trial banish or deport
them! Tear out the evil by the roots!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s said that this filibuster is the
descendant of Spaniards,&rdquo; observed the one-armed man, without
looking at any one in particular.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the fat lady,
unterrified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the creoles! No Indian knows
anything about revolution! Rear crows, rear crows!&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;ve heard?&rdquo; asked a
creole lady, to change the topic of conversation. &ldquo;The wife of
Capitan Tinong, you remember her, the woman in whose house we danced
and dined during the fiesta of Tondo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The one who has two daughters? What about
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, that woman just this afternoon presented
the Captain-General with a ring worth a thousand pesos!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The one-armed man turned around. &ldquo;Is that so?
Why?&rdquo; he asked with shining eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She said that it was a Christmas
gift&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But Christmas doesn&rsquo;t come for a month
yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s afraid the storm is blowing
her way,&rdquo; observed the fat lady.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And is getting under cover,&rdquo; added the thin
se&ntilde;ora.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When no return is asked, it&rsquo;s a confession
of guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This must be carefully looked into,&rdquo;
declared the one-armed man thoughtfully. &ldquo;I fear that
there&rsquo;s a cat in the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A cat in the bag, yes! That&rsquo;s just what I
was going to say,&rdquo; echoed the thin lady.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And so was I,&rdquo; said the other, taking the
words out of her mouth, &ldquo;the wife of Capitan Tinong is so
stingy&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t yet sent us any present and that after
we&rsquo;ve been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10661" href=
"#xd24e10661" name="xd24e10661">458</a>]</span>in her house. So, when
such a grasping and covetous woman lets go of a little present worth a
thousand pesos&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, is it a fact?&rdquo; inquired the one-armed
man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Certainly! Most certainly! My cousin&rsquo;s
sweetheart, his Excellency&rsquo;s adjutant, told her so. And I&rsquo;m
of the opinion that it&rsquo;s the very same ring that the older
daughter wore on the day of the fiesta. She&rsquo;s always covered with
diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A walking show-case!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A way of attracting attention, like any other!
Instead of buying a fashion plate or paying a
dressmaker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Giving some pretext, the one-armed man left the
gathering. Two hours later, when the world slept, various residents of
Tondo received an invitation through some soldiers. The authorities
could not consent to having certain persons of position and property
sleep in such poorly guarded and badly ventilated houses&mdash;in Fort
Santiago and other government buildings their sleep would be calmer and
more refreshing. Among these favored persons was included the
unfortunate Capitan Tinong. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10673"

<h2 class="main">Maria Clara Weds</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Capitan Tiago was very happy, for in all this
terrible storm no one had taken any notice of him. He had not been
arrested, nor had he been subjected to solitary confinement,
investigations, electric machines, continuous foot-baths in underground
cells, or other pleasantries that are well-known to certain folk who
call themselves civilized. His friends, that is, those who had been his
friends&mdash;for the good man had denied all his Filipino friends from
the instant when they were suspected by the government&mdash;had also
returned to their homes after a few days&rsquo; vacation in the state
edifices. The Captain-General himself had ordered that they be cast out
from his precincts, not considering them worthy of remaining therein,
to the great disgust of the one-armed individual, who had hoped to
celebrate the approaching Christmas in their abundant and opulent
company.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tinong had returned to his home sick, pale, and
swollen; the excursion had not done him good. He was so changed that he
said not a word, nor even greeted his family, who wept, laughed,
chattered, and almost went mad with joy. The poor man no longer
ventured out of his house for fear of running the risk of saying
good-day to a filibuster. Not even Don Primitivo himself, with all the
wisdom of the ancients, could draw him out of his silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Crede, prime</i>,&rdquo; the Latinist told
him, &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t got here to burn all your papers, they
would have squeezed your neck; and if I had burned the whole house they
wouldn&rsquo;t have touched a hair of your head. But <i lang="la">quod
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10690" href="#xd24e10690" name=
"xd24e10690">460</a>]</span>eventum, eventum; gratias agamus Domino Deo
quia non in Marianis Insulis es, camotes seminando</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e10693src" href="#xd24e10693" name=
"xd24e10693src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Stories similar to Capitan Tinong&rsquo;s were not
unknown to Capitan Tiago, so he bubbled over with gratitude, without
knowing exactly to whom he owed such signal favors. Aunt Isabel
attributed the miracle to the Virgin of Antipolo, to the Virgin of the
Rosary, or at least to the Virgin of Carmen, and at the very, very
least that she was willing to concede, to Our Lady of the Girdle;
according to her the miracle could not get beyond that.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago did not deny the miracle, but added:
&ldquo;I think so, Isabel, but the Virgin of Antipolo couldn&rsquo;t
have done it alone. My friends have helped, my future son-in-law,
Se&ntilde;or Linares, who, as you know, joked with Se&ntilde;or Antonio
Canovas himself, the premier whose portrait appears in the
<i>Ilustraci&oacute;n</i>, he who doesn&rsquo;t condescend to show more
than half his face to the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the good man could not repress a smile of
satisfaction every time that he heard any important news. And there was
plenty of news: it was whispered about in secret that Ibarra would be
hanged; that, while many proofs of his guilt had been lacking, at last
some one had appeared to sustain the accusation; that experts had
declared that in fact the work on the schoolhouse could pass for a
bulwark of fortification, although somewhat defective, as was only to
be expected of ignorant Indians. These rumors calmed him and made him
smile.</p>
<p class="par">In the same way that Capitan Tiago and his cousin
diverged in their opinions, the friends of the family were also divided
into two parties,&mdash;one miraculous, the other governmental,
although this latter was insignificant. The miraculous party was again
subdivided: the senior sacristan of Binondo, the candle-woman, and the
leader of the Brotherhood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10707"
href="#xd24e10707" name="xd24e10707">461</a>]</span>saw the hand of God
directed by the Virgin of the Rosary; while the Chinese wax-chandler,
his caterer on his visits to Antipolo, said, as he fanned himself and
shook his leg:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool yourself&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
Virgin of Antipolo! She can do more than all the rest&mdash;don&rsquo;t
fool yourself!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10711src" href=
"#xd24e10711" name="xd24e10711src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago had great respect for this Chinese, who
passed himself off as a prophet and a physician. Examining the palm of
the deceased lady just before her daughter was born, he had
prognosticated: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not a boy and doesn&rsquo;t die,
it&rsquo;ll be a fine girl!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10722src"
href="#xd24e10722" name="xd24e10722src">3</a> and Maria Clara had come
into the world to fulfill the infidel&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago, then, as a prudent and cautious man,
could not decide so easily as Trojan Paris&mdash;he could not so
lightly give the preference to one Virgin for fear of offending
another, a situation that might be fraught with grave consequences.
&ldquo;Prudence!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not go
and spoil it all now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was still in the midst of these doubts when the
governmental party arrived,&mdash;Do&ntilde;a Victorina, Don Tiburcio,
and Linares. Do&ntilde;a Victorina did the talking for the three men as
well as for herself. She mentioned Linares&rsquo; visits to the
Captain-General and repeatedly insinuated the advantages of a relative
of &ldquo;quality.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;as
we was zaying: he who zhelterz himzelf well, builds a good
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;T-the other w-way, w-woman!&rdquo; corrected the
doctor.</p>
<p class="par">For some days now she had been endeavoring to
<i>Andalusize</i> her speech, and no one had been able to get this idea
out of her head&mdash;she would sooner have first let them tear off her
false frizzes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yez,&rdquo; she went on, speaking of Ibarra,
&ldquo;he deserves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10739" href=
"#xd24e10739" name="xd24e10739">462</a>]</span>it all. I told you zo
when I first zaw him, he&rsquo;s a filibuzter. What did the General zay
to you, cousin? What did he zay? What news did he tell you about thiz
Ibarra?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Seeing that her cousin was slow in answering, she
continued, directing her remarks to Capitan Tiago, &ldquo;Believe me,
if they zentenz him to death, as is to be hoped, it&rsquo;ll be on
account of my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, se&ntilde;ora!&rdquo; protested
Linares.</p>
<p class="par">But she gave him no time for objections. &ldquo;How
diplomatic you have become! We know that you&rsquo;re the adviser of
the General, that he couldn&rsquo;t live without you. Ah, Clarita, what
a pleasure to zee you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara was still pale, although now quite recovered
from her illness. Her long hair was tied up with a light blue silk
ribbon. With a timid bow and a sad smile she went up to Do&ntilde;a
Victorina for the ceremonial kiss.</p>
<p class="par">After the usual conventional remarks, the
pseudo-Andalusian continued: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to visit you.
You&rsquo;ve been zaved, thankz to your relations.&rdquo; This was said
with a significant glance toward Linares.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God has protected my father,&rdquo; replied the
girl in a low voice.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yez, Clarita, but the time of the miracles is
pazt. We Zpaniards zay: &lsquo;Truzt in the Virgin and take to your
heels.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;T-the other w-way!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Tiago, who had up to this point had no chance to
speak, now made bold enough to ask, while he threw himself into an
attitude of strict attention, &ldquo;So you, Do&ntilde;a Victorina,
think that the Virgin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come ezpezially to talk with you
about the virgin,&rdquo; she answered mysteriously, making a sign
toward Maria Clara. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to talk
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The maiden understood that she was expected to retire,
so with an excuse she went away, supporting herself on the
furniture.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10765" href=
"#xd24e10765" name="xd24e10765">463</a>]</span>What was said and what
was agreed upon in this conference was so sordid and mean that we
prefer not to recount it. It is enough to record that as they took
their leave they were all merry, and that afterwards Capitan Tiago said
to Aunt Isabel:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Notify the restaurant that we&rsquo;ll have a
fiesta tomorrow. Get Maria ready, for we&rsquo;re going to marry her
off before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aunt Isabel stared at him in consternation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see! When Se&ntilde;or Linares is
our son-in-law we&rsquo;ll get into all the palaces. Every one will
envy us, every one will die of envy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Thus it happened that at eight o&rsquo;clock on the
following evening the house of Capitan Tiago was once again filled, but
this time his guests were only Spaniards and Chinese. The fair sex was
represented by Peninsular and Philippine-Spanish ladies.</p>
<p class="par">There were present the greater part of our
acquaintances: Padre Sibyla and Padre Salvi among various Franciscans
and Dominicans; the old lieutenant of the Civil Guard, Se&ntilde;or
Guevara, gloomier than ever; the alferez, who was for the thousandth
time describing his battle and gazing over his shoulders at every one,
believing himself to be a Don John of Austria, for he was now a major;
De Espada&ntilde;a, who looked at the alferez with respect and fear,
and avoided his gaze; and Do&ntilde;a Victorina, swelling with
indignation. Linares had not yet come; as a personage of importance, he
had to arrive later than the others. There are creatures so simple that
by being an hour behind time they transform themselves into great
men.</p>
<p class="par">In the group of women Maria Clara was the subject of a
murmured conversation. The maiden had welcomed them all ceremoniously,
without losing her air of sadness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; remarked one young woman. &ldquo;The
proud little thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pretty little thing!&rdquo; responded another.
&ldquo;But he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10784" href=
"#xd24e10784" name="xd24e10784">464</a>]</span>might have picked out
some other girl with a less foolish face.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The gold, child! The good youth is selling
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In another part the comments ran thus:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To get married when her first fianc&eacute; is
about to be hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called prudence, having
a substitute ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, when she gets to be a
widow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara was seated in a chair arranging a salver of
flowers and doubtless heard all these remarks, for her hand trembled,
she turned pale, and several times bit her lips.</p>
<p class="par">In the circle of men the conversation was carried on in
loud tones and, naturally, turned upon recent events. All were talking,
even Don Tiburcio, with the exception of Padre Sibyla, who maintained
his usual disdainful silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it said that your Reverence is
leaving the town, Padre Salvi?&rdquo; inquired the new major, whose
fresh star had made him more amiable.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have nothing more to do there. I&rsquo;m going
to stay permanently in Manila. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also leaving the town,&rdquo; answered
the ex-alferez, swelling up. &ldquo;The government needs me to command
a flying column to clean the provinces of filibusters.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Fray Sibyla looked him over rapidly from head to foot
and then turned his back completely.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it known for certain what will become of the
ringleader, the filibuster?&rdquo; inquired a government employee.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you mean Crisostomo Ibarra?&rdquo; asked
another. &ldquo;The most likely and most just thing is that he will be
hanged, like those of &rsquo;72.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to be deported,&rdquo; remarked
the old lieutenant, dryly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Deported! Nothing more than deported? But it will
be a perpetual deportation!&rdquo; exclaimed several voices at the same
time.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10818" href=
"#xd24e10818" name="xd24e10818">465</a>]</span>&ldquo;If that young
man,&rdquo; continued the lieutenant, Guevara, in a loud and severe
tone, &ldquo;had been more cautious, if he had confided less in certain
persons with whom he corresponded, if our prosecutors did not know how
to interpret so subtly what is written, that young man would surely
have been acquitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This declaration on the part of the old lieutenant and
the tone of his voice produced great surprise among his hearers, who
were apparently at a loss to know what to say. Padre Salvi stared in
another direction, perhaps to avoid the gloomy look that the old
soldier turned on him. Maria Clara let her flowers fall and remained
motionless. Padre Sibyla, who knew so well how to be silent, seemed
also to be the only one who knew how to ask a question.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re speaking of letters, Se&ntilde;or
Guevara?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking of what was told me by his
lawyer, who looked after the case with interest and zeal. Outside of
some ambiguous lines which this youth wrote to a woman before he left
for Europe, lines in which the government&rsquo;s attorney saw a plot
and a threat against the government, and which he acknowledged to be
his, there wasn&rsquo;t anything found to accuse him of.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the declaration of the outlaw before he
died?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His lawyer had that thrown out because, according
to the outlaw himself, they had never communicated with the young man,
but with a certain Lucas, who was an enemy of his, as could be proved,
and who committed suicide, perhaps from remorse. It was proved that the
papers found on the corpse were forged, since the handwriting was like
that of Se&ntilde;or Ibarra&rsquo;s seven years ago, but not like his
now, which leads to the belief that the model for them may have been
that incriminating letter. Besides, the lawyer says that if
Se&ntilde;or Ibarra had refused to acknowledge the letter, he might
have been able to do a great deal for him&mdash;but at sight of the
letter he turned pale, lost his courage, and confirmed everything
written in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10832" href=
"#xd24e10832" name="xd24e10832">466</a>]</span>&ldquo;Did you say that
the letter was directed to a woman?&rdquo; asked a Franciscan.
&ldquo;How did it get into the hands of the prosecutor?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The lieutenant did not answer. He stared for a moment at
Padre Salvi and then moved away, nervously twisting the sharp point of
his gray beard. The others made their comments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is seen the hand of God!&rdquo; remarked
one. &ldquo;Even the women hate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He had his house burned down, thinking in that
way to save himself, but he didn&rsquo;t count on the guest, on his
<i>querida</i>, his <i>babaye</i>,&rdquo; added another, laughing.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the work of God! <i>Santiago y cierra
Espa&ntilde;a!</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e10849src" href=
"#xd24e10849" name="xd24e10849src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile the old soldier paused in his pacing about and
approached Maria Clara, who was listening to the conversation,
motionless in her chair, with the flowers scattered at her feet.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are a very prudent girl,&rdquo; the old
officer whispered to her. &ldquo;You did well to give up the letter.
You have thus assured yourself an untroubled future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With startled eyes she watched him move away from her,
and bit her lip. Fortunately, Aunt Isabel came along, and she had
sufficient strength left to catch hold of the old lady&rsquo;s
skirt.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aunt!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the old
lady, frightened by the look on the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take me to my room!&rdquo; she pleaded, grasping
her aunt&rsquo;s arm in order to rise.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you sick, daughter? You look as if
you&rsquo;d lost your bones! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A fainting spell&mdash;the people in the
room&mdash;so many lights&mdash;I need to rest. Tell father that
I&rsquo;m going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cold. Do you want some
tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara shook her head, entered and locked the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10876" href="#xd24e10876" name=
"xd24e10876">467</a>]</span>door of her chamber, and then, her strength
failing her, she fell sobbing to the floor at the feet of an image.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother, mother, mother mine!&rdquo; she
sobbed.</p>
<p class="par">Through the window and a door that opened on the azotea
the moonlight entered. The musicians continued to play merry waltzes,
laughter and the hum of voices penetrated into the chamber, several
times her father, Aunt Isabel, Do&ntilde;a Victorina, and even Linares
knocked at the door, but Maria did not move. Heavy sobs shook her
breast.</p>
<p class="par">Hours passed&mdash;the pleasures of the dinner-table
ended, the sound of singing and dancing was heard, the candle burned
itself out, but the maiden still remained motionless on the moonlit
floor at the feet of an image of the Mother of Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">Gradually the house became quiet again, the lights were
extinguished, and Aunt Isabel once more knocked at the door.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s gone to sleep,&rdquo; said the
old woman, aloud. &ldquo;As she&rsquo;s young and has no cares, she
sleeps like a corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When all was silence she raised herself slowly and threw
a look about her. She saw the azotea with its little arbors bathed in
the ghostly light of the moon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;An untroubled future! She sleeps like a
corpse!&rdquo; she repeated in a low voice as she made her way out to
the azotea.</p>
<p class="par">The city slept. Only from time to time there was heard
the noise of a carriage crossing the wooden bridge over the river,
whose undisturbed waters reflected smoothly the light of the moon. The
young woman raised her eyes toward a sky as clear as sapphire. Slowly
she took the rings from her fingers and from her ears and removed the
combs from her hair. Placing them on the balustrade of the azotea, she
gazed toward the river.</p>
<p class="par">A small banka loaded with zacate stopped at the foot of
the landing such as every house on the bank of the river has.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10897" href="#xd24e10897" name=
"xd24e10897">468</a>]</span>One of two men who were in it ran up the
stone stairway and jumped over the wall, and a few seconds later his
footsteps were heard on the stairs leading to the azotea.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara saw him pause on discovering her, but only
for a moment. Then he advanced slowly and stopped within a few paces of
her. Maria Clara recoiled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Crisostomo!&rdquo; she murmured, overcome with
fright.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, I am Crisostomo,&rdquo; replied the young
man gravely. &ldquo;An enemy, a man who has every reason for hating me,
Elias, has rescued me from the prison into which my friends threw
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A sad silence followed these words. Maria Clara bowed
her head and let her arms fall.</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra went on: &ldquo;Beside my mother&rsquo;s corpse I
swore that I would make you happy, whatever might be my destiny! You
can have been faithless to your oath, for she was not your mother; but
I, I who am her son, hold her memory so sacred that in spite of a
thousand difficulties I have come here to carry mine out, and fate has
willed that I should speak to you yourself. Maria, we shall never see
each other again&mdash;you are young and perhaps some day your
conscience may reproach you&mdash;I have come to tell you, before I go
away forever, that I forgive you. Now, may you be happy
and&mdash;farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra started to move away, but the girl stopped
him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Crisostomo,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;God has sent
you to save me from desperation. Hear me and then judge me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra tried gently to draw away from her. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t come to call you to account! I came to give you
peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that peace which you bring me.
Peace I will give myself. You despise me and your contempt will
embitter all the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra read the despair and sorrow depicted in the
suffering girl&rsquo;s face and asked her what she wished.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That you believe that I have always loved
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At this he smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, you doubt me! You doubt the friend of your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10926" href="#xd24e10926" name=
"xd24e10926">469</a>]</span>childhood, who has never hidden a single
thought from you!&rdquo; the maiden exclaimed sorrowfully. &ldquo;I
understand now! But when you hear my story, the sad story that was
revealed to me during my illness, you will have mercy on me, you will
not have that smile for my sorrow. Why did you not let me die in the
hands of my ignorant physician? You and I both would have been
happier!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Resting a moment, she then went on: &ldquo;You have
desired it, you have doubted me! But may my mother forgive me! On one
of the sorrowfulest of my nights of suffering, a man revealed to me the
name of my real father and forbade me to love you&mdash;except that my
father himself should pardon the injury you had done him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra recoiled a pace and gazed fearfully at her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that man told
me that he could not permit our union, since his conscience would
forbid it, and that he would be obliged to reveal the name of my real
father at the risk of causing a great scandal, for my father
is&mdash;&rdquo; And she murmured into the youth&rsquo;s ear a name in
so low a tone that only he could have heard it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What was I to do? Must I sacrifice to my love the
memory of my mother, the honor of my supposed father, and the good name
of the real one? Could I have done that without having even you despise
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the proof! Had you any proof? You needed
proofs!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra, trembling with emotion.</p>
<p class="par">The maiden snatched two papers from her bosom.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Two letters of my mother&rsquo;s, two letters
written in the midst of her remorse, while I was yet unborn! Take them,
read them, and you will see how she cursed me and wished for my death,
which my father vainly tried to bring about with drugs. These letters
he had forgotten in a building where he had lived; the other man found
and preserved them and only gave them up to me in exchange for your
letter, in order to assure himself, so he said, that I would not marry
you without the consent of my father. Since I have been carrying them
about with me, in place of your <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e10943" href="#xd24e10943" name=
"xd24e10943">470</a>]</span>letter, I have, felt the chill in my heart.
I sacrificed you, I sacrificed my love! What else could one do for a
dead mother and two living fathers? Could I have suspected the use that
was to be made of your letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ibarra stood appalled, while she continued: &ldquo;What
more was left for me to do? Could I perhaps tell you who my father was,
could I tell you that you should beg forgiveness of him who made your
father suffer so much? Could I ask my father that he forgive you, could
I tell him that I knew that I was his daughter&mdash;him, who desired
my death so eagerly? It was only left to me to suffer, to guard the
secret, and to die suffering! Now, my friend, now that you know the sad
history of your poor Maria, will you still have for her that disdainful
smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Maria, you are an angel!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I am happy, since you believe
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But yet,&rdquo; added the youth with a change of
tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that you are going to be
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sobbed the girl, &ldquo;my father
demands this sacrifice. He has loved me and cared for me when it was
not his duty to do so, and I will pay this debt of gratitude to assure
his peace, by means of this new relationship, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will never forget the vows of faithfulness that
I have made to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are you thinking of doing?&rdquo; asked
Ibarra, trying to read the look in her eyes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The future is dark and my destiny is wrapped in
gloom! I don&rsquo;t know what I should do. But know, that I have loved
but once and that without love I will never belong to any man. And you,
what is going to become of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am only a fugitive, I am fleeing. In a little
while my flight will have been discovered. Maria&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara caught the youth&rsquo;s head in her hands
and kissed him repeatedly on the lips, embraced him, and drew abruptly
away. &ldquo;Go, go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Go, and
farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10969" href=
"#xd24e10969" name="xd24e10969">471</a>]</span>Ibarra gazed at her with
shining eyes, but at a gesture from her moved away&mdash;intoxicated,
wavering.</p>
<p class="par">Once again he leaped over the wall and stepped into the
banka. Maria Clara, leaning over the balustrade, watched him depart.
Elias took off his hat and bowed to her profoundly. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Listen, sir, to the plan that I have worked
out,&rdquo; said Elias thoughtfully, as they moved in the direction of
San Gabriel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hide you now in the house of a friend of
mine in Mandaluyong. I&rsquo;ll bring you all your money, which I saved
and buried at the foot of the balete in the mysterious tomb of your
grandfather. Then you will leave the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To go abroad?&rdquo; inquired Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To live out in peace the days of life that remain
to you. You have friends in Spain, you are rich, you can get yourself
pardoned. In every way a foreign country is for us a better fatherland
than our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Crisostomo did not answer, but meditated in silence. At
that moment they reached the Pasig and the banka began to ascend the
current. Over the Bridge of Spain a horseman galloped rapidly, while a
shrill, prolonged whistle was heard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; said Ibarra, &ldquo;you owe your
misfortunes to my family, you have saved my life twice, and I owe you
not only gratitude but also the restitution of your fortune. You advise
me to go abroad&mdash;then come with me and we will live like brothers.
Here you also are wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Elias shook his head sadly and answered:
&ldquo;Impossible! It&rsquo;s true that I cannot love or be happy in my
country, but I can suffer and die in it, and perhaps for it&mdash;that
is always something. May the misfortunes of my native land be my own
misfortunes and, although no noble sentiment unites us, although our
hearts do not beat to a single name, at least may the common calamity
bind me to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e10991" href="#xd24e10991"
name="xd24e10991">473</a>]</span>my countrymen, at least may I weep
over our sorrows with them, may the same hard fate oppress all our
hearts alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then why do you advise me to go away?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because in some other country you could be happy
while I could not, because you are not made to suffer, and because you
would hate your country if some day you should see yourself ruined in
its cause, and to hate one&rsquo;s native land is the greatest of
calamities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are unfair to me!&rdquo; exclaimed Ibarra
with bitter reproach. &ldquo;You forget that scarcely had I arrived
here when I set myself to seek its welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, sir, I was not
reproaching you at all. Would that all of us could imitate you! But I
do not ask impossibilities of you and I mean no offense when I say that
your heart deceives you. You loved your country because your father
taught you to do so; you loved it because in it you had affection,
fortune, youth, because everything smiled on you, your country had done
you no injustice; you loved it as we love anything that makes us happy.
But the day in which you see yourself poor and hungry, persecuted,
betrayed, and sold by your own countrymen, on that day you will disown
yourself, your country, and all mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your words pain me,&rdquo; said Ibarra
resentfully.</p>
<p class="par">Elias bowed his head and meditated before replying.
&ldquo;I wish to disillusion you, sir, and save you from a sad future.
Recall that night when I talked to you in this same banka under the
light of this same moon, not a month ago. Then you were happy, the plea
of the unfortunates did not touch you; you disdained their complaints
because they were the complaints of criminals; you paid more attention
to their enemies, and in spite of my arguments and petitions, you
placed yourself on the side of their oppressors. On you then depended
whether I should turn criminal or allow myself to be killed in order to
carry out a sacred pledge, but God has not permitted this because the
old chief of the outlaws <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11006"
href="#xd24e11006" name="xd24e11006">474</a>]</span>is dead. A month
has hardly passed and you think otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Elias, but man is a creature
of circumstances! Then I was blind, annoyed&mdash;what did I know? Now
misfortune has torn the bandage from my eyes; the solitude and misery
of my prison have taught me; now I see the horrible cancer which feeds
upon this society, which clutches its flesh, and which demands a
violent rooting out. They have opened my eyes, they have made me see
the sore, and they force me to be a criminal! Since they wish it, I
will be a filibuster, a real filibuster, I mean. I will call together
all the unfortunates, all who feel a heart beat in their breasts, all
those who were sending you to me. No, I will not be a criminal, never
is he such who fights for his native land, but quite the reverse! We,
during three centuries, have extended them our hands, we have asked
love of them, we have yearned to call them brothers, and how do they
answer us? With insults and jests, denying us even the chance character
of human beings. There is no God, there is no hope, there is no
humanity; there is nothing but the right of might!&rdquo; Ibarra was
nervous, his whole body trembled.</p>
<p class="par">As they passed in front of the Captain-General&rsquo;s
palace they thought that they could discern movement and excitement
among the guards.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can they have discovered your flight?&rdquo;
murmured Elias. &ldquo;Lie down, sir, so that I can cover you with
zacate. Since we shall pass near the powder-magazine it may seem
suspicious to the sentinel that there are two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The banka was one of those small, narrow canoes that do
not seem to float but rather to glide over the top of the water. As
Elias had foreseen, the sentinel stopped him and inquired whence he
came.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From Manila, to carry zacate to the judges and
curates,&rdquo; he answered, imitating the accent of the people of
Pandakan.</p>
<p class="par">A sergeant came out to learn what was happening.
&ldquo;Move on!&rdquo; he said to Elias. &ldquo;But I warn you not to
take <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11020" href="#xd24e11020" name=
"xd24e11020">475</a>]</span>anybody into your banka. A prisoner has
just escaped. If you capture him and turn him over to me I&rsquo;ll
give you a good tip.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All right, sir. What&rsquo;s his
description?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He wears a sack coat and talks Spanish. So look
out!&rdquo; The banka moved away. Elias looked back and watched the
silhouette of the sentinel standing on the bank of the river.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose a few minutes&rsquo;
time,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;We must go into the Beata
River to pretend that I&rsquo;m from Pe&ntilde;afrancia. You will see
the river of which Francisco Baltazar sang.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The town slept in the moonlight, and Crisostomo rose up
to admire the sepulchral peace of nature. The river was narrow and the
level land on either side covered with grass. Elias threw his cargo out
on the bank and, after removing a large piece of bamboo, took from
under the grass some empty palm-leaf sacks. Then they continued on
their way.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are the master of your own will, sir, and of
your future,&rdquo; he said to Crisostomo, who had remained silent.
&ldquo;But if you will allow me an observation, I would say: think well
what you are planning to do&mdash;you are going to light the flames of
war, since you have money and brains, and you will quickly find many to
join you, for unfortunately there are plenty of malcontents. But in
this struggle which you are going to undertake, those who will suffer
most will be the defenseless and the innocent. The same sentiments that
a month ago impelled me to appeal to you asking for reforms are those
that move me now to urge you to think well. The country, sir, does not
think of separating from the mother country; it only asks for a little
freedom, justice, and affection. You will be supported by the
malcontents, the criminals, the desperate, but the people will hold
aloof. You are mistaken if, seeing all dark, you think that the country
is desperate. The country suffers, yes, but it still hopes and trusts
and will only rebel when it has lost its patience, that is, when those
who govern it wish it to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11033"
href="#xd24e11033" name="xd24e11033">476</a>]</span>do so, and that
time is yet distant. I myself will not follow you, never will I resort
to such extreme measures while I see hope in men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go on without you!&rdquo;
responded Ibarra resolutely.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is your decision final?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Final and firm; let the memory of my mother bear
witness! I will not let peace and happiness be torn away from me with
impunity, I who desired only what was good, I who have respected
everything and endured everything out of love for a hypocritical
religion and out of love of country. How have they answered me? By
burying me in an infamous dungeon and robbing me of my intended wife!
No, not to avenge myself would be a crime, it would be encouraging them
to new acts of injustice! No, it would be cowardice, pusillanimity, to
groan and weep when there is blood and life left, when to insult and
menace is added mockery. I will call out these ignorant people, I will
make them see their misery. I will teach them to think not of
brotherhood but only that they are wolves for devouring, I will urge
them to rise against this oppression and proclaim the eternal right of
man to win his freedom!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But innocent people will suffer!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So much the better! Can you take me to the
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Until you are in safety,&rdquo; replied
Elias.</p>
<p class="par">Again they moved out into the Pasig, talking from time
to time of indifferent matters.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Santa Ana!&rdquo; murmured Ibarra. &ldquo;Do you
recognize this building?&rdquo; They were passing in front of the
country-house of the Jesuits.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There I spent many pleasant and happy
days!&rdquo; sighed Elias. &ldquo;In my time we came every month. Then
I was like others, I had a fortune, family, I dreamed, I looked forward
to a future. In those days I saw my sister in the near-by college, she
presented me with a piece of her own <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e11054" href="#xd24e11054" name=
"xd24e11054">477</a>]</span>embroidery-work. A friend used to accompany
her, a beautiful girl. All that has passed like a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They remained silent until they reached
Malapad-na-bato.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11058src" href=
"#xd24e11058" name="xd24e11058src">1</a> Those who have ever made their
way by night up the Pasig, on one of those magical nights that the
Philippines offers, when the moon pours out from the limpid blue her
melancholy light, when the shadows hide the miseries of man and the
silence is unbroken by the sordid accents of his voice, when only
Nature speaks&mdash;they will understand the thoughts of both these
youths.</p>
<p class="par">At Malapad-na-bato the carbineer was sleepy and, seeing
that the banka was empty and offered no booty which he might seize,
according to the traditional usage of his corps and the custom of that
post, he easily let them pass on. Nor did the civil-guard at Pasig
suspect anything, so they were not molested.</p>
<p class="par">Day was beginning to break when they reached the lake,
still and calm like a gigantic mirror. The moon paled and the east was
dyed in rosy tints. Some distance away they perceived a gray mass
advancing slowly toward them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The police boat is coming,&rdquo; murmured Elias.
&ldquo;Lie down and I&rsquo;ll cover you with these sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The outlines of the boat became clearer and plainer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting between us and the
shore,&rdquo; observed Elias uneasily.</p>
<p class="par">Gradually he changed the course of his banka, rowing
toward Binangonan. To his great surprise he noticed that the boat also
changed its course, while a voice called to him.</p>
<p class="par">Elias stopped rowing and reflected. The shore was still
far away and they would soon be within range of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11075" href="#xd24e11075" name=
"xd24e11075">478</a>]</span>rifles on the police boat. He thought of
returning to Pasig, for his banka was the swifter of the two boats, but
unluckily he saw another boat coming from the river and made out the
gleam of caps and bayonets of the Civil Guard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re caught!&rdquo; he muttered, turning
pale.</p>
<p class="par">He gazed at his robust arms and, adopting the only
course left, began to row with all his might toward Talim Island, just
as the sun was rising.</p>
<p class="par">The banka slipped rapidly along. Elias saw standing on
the boat, which had veered about, some men making signals to him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know how to manage a banka?&rdquo; he
asked Ibarra.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because we are lost if I don&rsquo;t jump into
the water and throw them off the track. They will pursue me, but I swim
and dive well. I&rsquo;ll draw them away from you and then you can save
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, stay here, and we&rsquo;ll sell our lives
dearly!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That would be useless. We have no arms and with
their rifles they would shoot us down like birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At that instant the water gave forth a hiss such as is
caused by the falling of hot metal into it, followed instantaneously by
a loud report.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; said Elias, placing the paddle in
the boat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see each other on Christmas Eve at the
tomb of your grandfather. Save yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God has carried me safely through greater
perils.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As Elias took off his camisa a bullet tore it from his
hands and two loud reports were heard. Calmly he clasped the hand of
Ibarra, who was still stretched out in the bottom of the banka. Then he
arose and leaped into the water, at the same time pushing the little
craft away from him with his foot.</p>
<p class="par">Cries resounded, and soon some distance away the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11107" href="#xd24e11107" name=
"xd24e11107">479</a>]</span>youth&rsquo;s head appeared, as if for
breathing, then instantly disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There, there he is!&rdquo; cried several voices,
and again the bullets whistled.</p>
<p class="par">The police boat and the boat from the Pasig now started
in pursuit of him. A light track indicated his passage through the
water as he drew farther and farther away from Ibarra&rsquo;s banka,
which floated about as if abandoned. Every time the swimmer lifted his
head above the water to breathe, the guards in both boats shot at
him.</p>
<p class="par">So the chase continued. Ibarra&rsquo;s little banka was
now far away and the swimmer was approaching the shore, distant some
thirty yards. The rowers were tired, but Elias was in the same
condition, for he showed his head oftener, and each time in a different
direction, as if to disconcert his pursuers. No longer did the
treacherous track indicate the position of the diver. They saw him for
the last time when he was some ten yards from the shore, and fired.
Then minute after minute passed, but nothing again appeared above the
still and solitary surface of the lake.</p>
<p class="par">Half an hour afterwards one of the rowers claimed that
he could distinguish in the water near the shore traces of blood, but
his companions shook their heads dubiously. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Padre Damaso Explains</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Vainly were the rich wedding presents heaped upon
a table; neither the diamonds in their cases of blue velvet, nor the
pi&ntilde;a embroideries, nor the rolls of silk, drew the gaze of Maria
Clara. Without reading or even seeing it the maiden sat staring at the
newspaper which gave an account of the death of Ibarra, drowned in the
lake.</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly she felt two hands placed over her eyes to hold
her fast and heard Padre Damaso&rsquo;s voice ask merrily, &ldquo;Who
am I? Who am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara sprang from her seat and gazed at him in
terror.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Foolish little girl, you&rsquo;re not afraid, are
you? You weren&rsquo;t expecting me, eh? Well, I&rsquo;ve come in from
the provinces to attend your wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He smiled with satisfaction as he drew nearer to her and
held out his hand for her to kiss. Maria Clara approached him
tremblingly and touched his hand respectfully to her lips.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Maria?&rdquo;
asked the Franciscan, losing his merry smile and becoming uneasy.
&ldquo;Your hand is cold, you&rsquo;re pale. Are you ill, little
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Padre Damaso drew her toward himself with a tenderness
that one would hardly have thought him capable of, and catching both
her hands in his questioned her with his gaze.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have confidence in your godfather
any more?&rdquo; he asked reproachfully. &ldquo;Come, sit down and tell
me your little troubles as you used to do when you were a child, when
you wanted tapers to make wax dolls, You <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e11139" href="#xd24e11139" name="xd24e11139">481</a>]</span>know
that I&rsquo;ve always loved you, I&rsquo;ve never been cross with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">His voice was now no longer brusque, and even became
tenderly modulated. Maria Clara began to weep.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying, little girl? Why do you cry?
Have you quarreled with Linares?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara covered her ears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak
of him not now!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p class="par">Padre Damaso gazed at her in startled wonder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you trust me with your secrets?
Haven&rsquo;t I always tried to satisfy your lightest whim?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The maiden raised eyes filled with tears and stared at
him for a long time, then again fell to weeping bitterly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry so, little girl. Your tears hurt
me. Tell me your troubles, and you&rsquo;ll see how your godfather
loves you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara approached him slowly, fell upon her knees,
and raising her tear-stained face toward his asked in a low, scarcely
audible tone, &ldquo;Do you still love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Child!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then, protect my father and break off my
marriage!&rdquo; Here the maiden told of her last interview with
Ibarra, concealing only her knowledge of the secret of her birth. Padre
Damaso could scarcely credit his ears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;While he lived,&rdquo; the girl continued,
&ldquo;I thought of struggling, I was hoping, trusting! I wanted to
live so that I might hear of him, but now that they have killed him,
now there is no reason why I should live and suffer.&rdquo; She spoke
in low, measured tones, calmly, tearlessly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, foolish girl, isn&rsquo;t Linares a thousand
times better than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;While he lived, I could have married&mdash;I
thought of running away afterwards&mdash;my father wants only the
relationship! But now that he is dead, no other man shall call me wife!
While he was alive I could debase myself, for there would have remained
the consolation that he lived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11169"
href="#xd24e11169" name="xd24e11169">482</a>]</span>and perhaps thought
of me, but now that he is dead&mdash;the nunnery or the
tomb!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl&rsquo;s voice had a ring of firmness in it such
that Padre Damaso lost his merry air and became very thoughtful.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did you love him as much as that?&rdquo; he
stammered.</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara did not answer. Padre Damaso dropped his
head on his chest and remained silent for a long time.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Daughter in God,&rdquo; he exclaimed at length in
a broken voice, &ldquo;forgive me for having made you unhappy without
knowing it. I was thinking of your future, I desired your happiness.
How could I permit you to marry a native of the country, to see you an
unhappy wife and a wretched mother? I couldn&rsquo;t get that love out
of your head even though I opposed it with all my might. I committed
wrongs, for you, solely for you. If you had become his wife you would
have mourned afterwards over the condition of your husband, exposed to
all kinds of vexations without means of defense. As a mother you would
have mourned the fate of your sons: if you had educated them, you would
have prepared for them a sad future, for they would have become enemies
of Religion and you would have seen them garroted or exiled; if you had
kept them ignorant, you would have seen them tyrannized over and
degraded. I could not consent to it! For this reason I sought for you a
husband that could make you the happy mother of sons who would command
and not obey, who would punish and not suffer. I knew that the friend
of your childhood was good, I liked him as well as his father, but I
have hated them both since I saw that they were going to bring about
your unhappiness, because I love you, I adore you, I love you as one
loves his own daughter! Yours is my only affection; I have seen you
grow&mdash;not an hour has passed that I have not thought of
you&mdash;I dreamed of you&mdash;you have been my only joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here Padre Damaso himself broke out into tears like a
child.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11182" href=
"#xd24e11182" name="xd24e11182">483</a>]</span>&ldquo;Then, as you love
me, don&rsquo;t make me eternally wretched. He no longer lives, so I
want to be a nun!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old priest rested his forehead on his hand.
&ldquo;To be a nun, a nun!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know, child, what the life is, the mystery that is hidden behind the
walls of the nunnery, you don&rsquo;t know! A thousand times would I
prefer to see you unhappy in the world rather than in the cloister.
Here your complaints can be heard, there you will have only the walls.
You are beautiful, very beautiful, and you were not born for
that&mdash;to be a bride of Christ! Believe me, little girl, time will
wipe away everything. Later on you will forget, you will love, you will
love your husband&mdash;Linares.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The nunnery or&mdash;death!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The nunnery, the nunnery, or death!&rdquo;
exclaimed Padre Damaso. &ldquo;Maria, I am now an old man, I shall not
be able much longer to watch over you and your welfare. Choose
something else, seek another love, some other man, whoever he may
be&mdash;anything but the nunnery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The nunnery or death!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My God, my God!&rdquo; cried the priest, covering
his head with his hands, &ldquo;Thou chastisest me, so let it be! But
watch over my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then, turning again to the young woman, he said,
&ldquo;You wish to be a nun, and it shall be so. I don&rsquo;t want you
to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Maria Clara caught both his hands in hers, clasping and
kissing them as she fell upon her knees, repeating over and over,
&ldquo;My godfather, I thank you, my godfather!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">With bowed head Fray Damaso went away, sad and sighing.
&ldquo;God, Thou dost exist, since Thou chastisest! But let Thy
vengeance fall on me, harm not the innocent. Save Thou my
daughter!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11201" href=

<h2 class="main">Christmas Eve</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">High up on the slope of the mountain near a
roaring stream a hut built on the gnarled logs hides itself among the
trees. Over its kogon thatch clambers the branching gourd-vine, laden
with flowers and fruit. Deer antlers and skulls of wild boar, some with
long tusks, adorn this mountain home, where lives a Tagalog family
engaged in hunting and cutting firewood.</p>
<p class="par">In the shade of a tree the grandsire was making brooms
from the fibers of palm leaves, while a young woman was placing eggs,
limes, and some vegetables in a wide basket. Two children, a boy and a
girl, were playing by the side of another, who, pale and sad, with
large eyes and a deep gaze, was seated on a fallen tree-trunk. In his
thinned features we recognize Sisa&rsquo;s son, Basilio, the brother of
Crispin.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When your foot gets well,&rdquo; the little girl
was saying to him, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll play hide-and-seek. I&rsquo;ll be
the leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go up to the top of the mountain
with us,&rdquo; added the little boy, &ldquo;and drink deer blood with
lime-juice and you&rsquo;ll get fat, and then I&rsquo;ll teach you how
to jump from rock to rock above the torrent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Basilio smiled sadly, stared at the sore on his foot,
and then turned his gaze toward the sun, which shone resplendently.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sell these brooms,&rdquo; said the grandfather to
the young woman, &ldquo;and buy something for the children, for
tomorrow is Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Firecrackers, I want some firecrackers!&rdquo;
exclaimed the boy.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11222" href=
"#xd24e11222" name="xd24e11222">485</a>]</span>&ldquo;I want a head for
my doll,&rdquo; cried the little girl, catching hold of her
sister&rsquo;s tapis.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you, what do you want?&rdquo; the grandfather
asked Basilio, who at the question arose laboriously and approached the
old man.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sick
more than a month now, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since we found you lifeless and covered with
wounds, two moons have come and gone. We thought you were going to
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May God reward you, for we are very poor,&rdquo;
replied Basilio. &ldquo;But now that tomorrow is Christmas I want to go
to the town to see my mother and my little brother. They will be
seeking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But, my son, you&rsquo;re not yet well, and your
town is far away. You won&rsquo;t get there by midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, sir. My mother and my
little brother must be very sad. Every year we spend this holiday
together. Last year the three of us had a whole fish to eat. My mother
will have been mourning and looking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get to the town alive, boy!
Tonight we&rsquo;re going to have chicken and wild boar&rsquo;s meat.
My sons will ask for you when they come from the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have many sons while my mother has only us
two. Perhaps she already believes that I&rsquo;m dead! Tonight I want
to give her a pleasant surprise, a Christmas gift, a son.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old man felt the tears springing up into his eyes,
so, placing his hands on the boy&rsquo;s head, he said with emotion:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re like an old man! Go, look for your mother, give her
the Christmas gift&mdash;from God, as you say. If I had known the name
of your town I would have gone there when you were sick. Go, my son,
and may God and the Lord Jesus go with you. Lucia, my granddaughter,
will go with you to the nearest town.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What! You&rsquo;re going away?&rdquo; the little
boy asked him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11245" href=
"#xd24e11245" name="xd24e11245">486</a>]</span>&ldquo;Down there are
soldiers and many robbers. Don&rsquo;t you want to see my firecrackers?
Boom, boom, boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to play
hide-and-seek?&rdquo; asked the little girl. &ldquo;Have you ever
played it? Surely there&rsquo;s nothing any more fun than to be chased
and hide yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Basilio smiled, but with tears in his eyes, and caught
up his staff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back soon,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring my little brother, you&rsquo;ll see him and
play with him. He&rsquo;s just about as big as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does he walk lame, too?&rdquo; asked the little
girl. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll make him &lsquo;it&rsquo; when we play
hide-and-seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget us,&rdquo; the old man said to
him. &ldquo;Take this dried meat as a present to your
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The children accompanied him to the bamboo bridge swung
over the noisy course of the stream. Lucia made him support himself on
her arm, and thus they disappeared from the children&rsquo;s sight,
Basilio walking along nimbly in spite of his bandaged leg.</p>
<p class="par">The north wind whistled by, making the inhabitants of
San Diego shiver with cold. It was Christmas Eve and yet the town was
wrapped in gloom. Not a paper lantern hung from the windows nor did a
single sound in the houses indicate the rejoicing of other years.</p>
<p class="par">In the house of Capitan Basilio, he and Don
Filipo&mdash;for the misfortunes of the latter had made them
friendly&mdash;were standing by a window-grating and talking, while at
another were Sinang, her cousin Victoria, and the beautiful Iday,
looking toward the street.</p>
<p class="par">The waning moon began to shine over the horizon,
illumining the clouds and making the trees and houses east long,
fantastic shadows.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yours is not a little good fortune, to get off
free in these times!&rdquo; said Capitan Basilio to Don Filipo.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve burned your books, yes, but others have lost
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A woman approached the grating and gazed into the
interior. Her eyes glittered, her features were emaciated, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11268" href="#xd24e11268" name=
"xd24e11268">487</a>]</span>her hair loose and dishevelled. The
moonlight gave her a weird aspect.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sisal&rdquo; exclaimed Don Filipo in surprise.
Then turning to Capitan Basilio, as the madwoman ran away, he asked,
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she in the house of a physician? Has she been
cured?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Capitan Basilio smiled bitterly. &ldquo;The physician
was afraid they would accuse him of being a friend of Don
Crisostomo&rsquo;s, so he drove her from his house. Now she wanders
about again as crazy as ever, singing, harming no one, and living in
the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What else has happened in the town since we left
it? I know that we have a new curate and another alferez.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These are terrible times, humanity is
retrograding,&rdquo; murmured Capitan Basilio, thinking of the past.
&ldquo;The day after you left they found the senior sacristan dead,
hanging from a rafter in his own house. Padre Salvi was greatly
affected by his death and took possession of all his papers. Ah, yes,
the old Sage, Tasio, also died and was buried in the Chinese
cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo; sighed Don Filipo.
&ldquo;What became of his books?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They were burned by the pious, who thought thus
to please God. I was unable to save anything, not even Cicero&rsquo;s
works. The gobernadorcillo did nothing to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Both became silent. At that moment the sad and
melancholy song of the madwoman was heard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know when Maria Clara is to be
married?&rdquo; Iday asked Sinang.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the latter.
&ldquo;I received a letter from her but haven&rsquo;t opened it for
fear of finding out. Poor Crisostomo!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They say that if it were not for Linares, they
would hang Capitan Tiago, so what was Maria Clara going to do?&rdquo;
observed Victoria.</p>
<p class="par">A boy limped by, running toward the plaza, whence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11293" href="#xd24e11293" name=
"xd24e11293">488</a>]</span>came the notes of Sisa&rsquo;s song. It was
Basilio, who had found his home deserted and in ruins. After many
inquiries he had only learned that his mother was insane and wandering
about the town&mdash;of Crispin not a word.</p>
<p class="par">Basilio choked back his tears, stifled any expression of
his sorrow, and without resting had started in search of his mother. On
reaching the town he was just asking about her when her song struck his
ears. The unhappy boy overcame the trembling in his limbs and ran to
throw himself into his mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p class="par">The madwoman left the plaza and stopped in front of the
house of the new alferez. Now, as formerly, there was a sentinel before
the door, and a woman&rsquo;s head appeared at the window, only it was
not the Medusa&rsquo;s but that of a comely young woman: alferez and
unfortunate are not synonymous terms.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa began to sing before the house with her gaze fixed
on the moon, which soared majestically in the blue heavens among golden
clouds. Basilio saw her, but did not dare to approach&rsquo; her.
Walking back and forth, but taking care not to get near the barracks,
he waited for the time when she would leave that place.</p>
<p class="par">The young woman who was at the window listening
attentively to the madwoman&rsquo;s song ordered the sentinel to bring
her inside, but when Sisa saw the soldier approach her and heard his
voice she was filled with terror and took to flight at a speed of which
only a demented person is capable. Basilio, fearing to lose her, ran
after her, forgetful of the pains in his feet.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look how that boy&rsquo;s chasing the
madwoman!&rdquo; indignantly exclaimed a woman in the street. Seeing
that he continued to pursue her, she picked up a stone and threw it at
him, saying, &ldquo;Take that! It&rsquo;s a pity that the dog is tied
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Basilio felt a blow on his head, but paid no attention
to it as he continued running. Dogs barked, geese cackled, several
windows opened to let out curious faces but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11308" href="#xd24e11308" name=
"xd24e11308">489</a>]</span>quickly closed again from fear of another
night of terror.</p>
<p class="par">Soon they were outside of the town. Sisa began to
moderate her flight, but still a great distance separated her from her
pursuer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he called to her when he caught
sight of her. Scarcely had the madwoman heard his voice when she again
took to flight.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s I!&rdquo; cried the boy in
desperation, but the madwoman did not heed him, so he followed panting.
They had now passed the cultivated fields and were near the wood;
Basilio saw his mother enter it and he also went in. The bushes and
shrubs, the thorny vines and projecting roots of trees, hindered the
movements of both. The son followed his mother&rsquo;s shadowy form as
it was revealed from time to time by the moonlight that penetrated
through the foliage and into the open spaces. They were in the
mysterious wood of the Ibarra family.</p>
<p class="par">The boy stumbled and fell several times, but rose again,
each time without feeling pain. All his soul was centered in his eyes,
following the beloved figure. They crossed the sweetly murmuring brook
where sharp thorns of bamboo that had fallen on the sand at its margin
pierced his bare feet, but he did not stop to pull them out.</p>
<p class="par">To his great surprise he saw that his mother had plunged
into the thick undergrowth and was going through the wooden gateway
that opened into the tomb of the old Spaniard at the foot of the
balete. Basilio tried to follow her in, but found the gate fastened.
The madwoman defended the entrance with her emaciated arms and
disheveled head, holding the gate shut with all her might.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s I, it&rsquo;s I! I&rsquo;m
Basilio, your son!&rdquo; cried the boy as he let himself fall
weakly.</p>
<p class="par">But the madwoman did not yield. Bracing herself with her
feet on the ground, she offered an energetic resistance. Basilio beat
the gate with his fists, with his Mood-stained head, he wept, but in
vain. Painfully he arose and examined <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd24e11324" href="#xd24e11324" name="xd24e11324">490</a>]</span>the
wall, thinking to scale it, but found no way to do so. He then walked
around it and noticed that a branch of the fateful balete was crossed
with one from another tree. This he climbed and, his filial love
working miracles, made his way from branch to branch to the balete,
from which he saw his mother still holding the gate shut with her
head.</p>
<p class="par">The noise made by him among the branches attracted
Sisa&rsquo;s attention. She turned and tried to run, but her son,
letting himself fall from the tree, caught her in his arms and covered
her with kisses, losing consciousness as he did so.</p>
<p class="par">Sisa saw his blood-stained forehead and bent over him.
Her eyes seemed to start from their sockets as she peered into his
face. Those pale features stirred the sleeping cells of her brain, so
that something like a spark of intelligence flashed up in her mind and
she recognized her son. With a terrible cry she fell upon the
insensible body of the boy, embracing and kissing him. Mother and son
remained motionless.</p>
<p class="par">When Basilio recovered consciousness he found his mother
lifeless. He called to her with the tenderest names, but she did not
awake. Noticing that she was not even breathing, he arose and went to
the neighboring brook to get some water in a banana leaf, with which to
rub the pallid face of his mother, but the madwoman made not the least
movement and her eyes remained closed.</p>
<p class="par">Basilio gazed at her in terror. He placed his ear over
her heart, but the thin, faded breast was cold, and her heart no longer
beat. He put his lips to hers, but felt no breathing. The miserable boy
threw his arms about the corpse and wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="par">The moon gleamed majestically in the sky, the wandering
breezes sighed, and down in the grass the crickets chirped. The night
of light and joy for so many children, who in the warm bosom of the
family celebrate this feast of sweetest memories&mdash;the feast which
commemorates the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11337" href=
"#xd24e11337" name="xd24e11337">491</a>]</span>first look of love that
Heaven sent to earth&mdash;this night when in all Christian families
they eat, drink, dance, sing, laugh, play, caress, and kiss one
another&mdash;this night, which in cold countries holds such magic for
childhood with its traditional pine-tree covered with lights, dolls,
candies, and tinsel, whereon gaze the round, staring eyes in which
innocence alone is reflected&mdash;this night brought to Basilio only
orphanhood. Who knows but that perhaps in the home whence came the
taciturn Padre Salvi children also played, perhaps they sang</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="par first">For a long time the boy wept and moaned. When at
last he raised his head he saw a man standing over him, gazing at the
scene in silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you her son?&rdquo; asked the unknown in a
low voice.</p>
<p class="par">The boy nodded.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you expect to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bury her!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the cemetery?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any money and, besides, the
curate wouldn&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If you would help me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very weak,&rdquo; answered the unknown
as he sank slowly to the ground, supporting himself with both hands.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wounded. For two days I haven&rsquo;t eaten or slept.
Has no one come here tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The man thoughtfully contemplated the attractive
features of the boy, then went on in a still weaker voice,
&ldquo;Listen! I, too, shall be dead before the day comes. Twenty paces
from here, on the other side of the brook, there is a big pile of
firewood. Bring it here, make a pyre, put our bodies upon it, cover
them over, and set fire to the whole&mdash;fire, until we are reduced
to ashes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11370" href=
"#xd24e11370" name="xd24e11370">492</a>]</span>Basilio listened
attentively.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Afterwards, if no one comes, dig here. You will
find a lot of gold and it will all be yours. Take it and go to
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The voice of the unknown was becoming every moment more
unintelligible. &ldquo;Go, get the firewood. I want to help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As Basilio moved away, the unknown turned his face
toward the east and murmured, as though praying:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I die without seeing the dawn brighten over my
native land! You, who have it to see, welcome it&mdash;and forget not
those who have fallen during the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He raised his eyes to the sky and his lips continued to
move, as if uttering a prayer. Then he bowed his head and sank slowly
to the earth.</p>
<p class="par">Two hours later Sister Rufa was on the back veranda of
her house making her morning ablutions in order to attend mass. The
pious woman gazed at the adjacent wood and saw a thick column of smoke
rising from it. Filled with holy indignation, she knitted her eyebrows
and exclaimed:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What heretic is making a clearing on a holy day?
That&rsquo;s why so many calamities come! You ought to go to purgatory
and see if you could get out of there, savage!&rdquo; <span class=

"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara, in whose nunnery he discharges the
duties of an important office. Not many months had passed when Padre
Damaso received an order from the Very Reverend Father Provincial to
occupy a curacy in a remote province. It is related that he was so
grievously affected by this that on the following day he was found dead
in his bedchamber. Some said that he had died of an apoplectic stroke,
others of a nightmare, but his physician dissipated all doubts by
declaring that he had died suddenly.</p>
<p class="par">None of our readers would now recognize Capitan Tiago.
Weeks before Maria Clara took the vows he fell into a state of
depression so great that he grew sad and thin, and became pensive and
distrustful, like his former friend, Capitan Tinong. As soon as the
doors of the nunnery closed he ordered his disconsolate cousin, Aunt
Isabel, to collect whatever had belonged to his daughter and his dead
wife and to go to make her home in Malabon or San Diego, since he
wished to live alone thenceforward, tie then devoted himself
passionately to <i>liam-p&oacute;</i> and the cockpit, and began to
smoke opium. He no longer goes to Antipolo nor does he order any more
masses, so Do&ntilde;a Patrocinia, his old rival, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11403" href="#xd24e11403" name=
"xd24e11403">494</a>]</span>celebrates her triumph piously by snoring
during the sermons. If at any time during the late afternoon you should
walk along Calle Santo Cristo, you would see seated in a Chinese shop a
small man, yellow, thin, and bent, with stained and dirty finger nails,
gazing through dreamy, sunken eyes at the passers-by as if he did not
see them. At nightfall you would see him rise with difficulty and,
supporting himself on his cane, make his way to a narrow little
by-street to enter a grimy building over the door of which may be seen
in large red letters: FUMADERO PUBLICO DE ANFION.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e11405src" href="#xd24e11405" name="xd24e11405src">1</a> This is
that Capitan Tiago who was so celebrated, but who is now completely
forgotten, even by the very senior sacristan himself.</p>
<p class="par">Do&ntilde;a Victorina has added to her false frizzes and
to her <i>Andalusization</i>, if we may be permitted the term, the new
custom of driving the carriage horses herself, obliging Don Tiburcio to
remain quiet. Since many unfortunate accidents occurred on account of
the weakness of her eyes, she has taken to wearing spectacles, which
give her a marvelous appearance. The doctor has never been called upon
again to attend any one and the servants see him many days in the week
without teeth, which, as our readers know, is a very bad sign. Linares,
the only defender of the hapless doctor, has long been at rest in Paco
cemetery, the victim of dysentery and the harsh treatment of his
cousin-in-law.</p>
<p class="par">The victorious alferez returned to Spain a major,
leaving his amiable spouse in her flannel camisa, the color of which is
now indescribable. The poor Ariadne, finding herself thus abandoned,
also devoted herself, as did the daughter of Minos, to the cult of
Bacchus and the cultivation of tobacco; she drinks and smokes with such
fury that now not only the girls but even the old women and little
children fear her.</p>
<p class="par">Probably our acquaintances of the town of San Diego are
still alive, if they did not perish in the explosion of the steamer
&ldquo;<i>Lipa</i>,&rdquo; which was making a trip to the province.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11420" href="#xd24e11420" name=
"xd24e11420">495</a>]</span>Since no one bothered himself to learn who
the unfortunates were that perished in that catastrophe or to whom
belonged the legs and arms left neglected on Convalescence Island and
the banks of the river, we have no idea whether any acquaintance of our
readers was among them or not. Along with the government and the press
at the time, we are satisfied with the information that the only friar
who was on the steamer was saved, and we do not ask for more. The
principal thing for us is the existence of the virtuous priests, whose
reign in the Philippines may God conserve for the good of our
souls.<a class="noteref" id="xd24e11422src" href="#xd24e11422" name=

<p class="par">Of Maria Clara nothing more is known except that the
sepulcher seems to guard her in its bosom. We have asked several
persons of great influence in the holy nunnery of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara, but no one has been willing to tell us a
single word, not even the talkative devotees who receive the famous
fried chicken-livers and the even more famous sauce known as that
&ldquo;of the nuns,&rdquo; prepared by the intelligent cook of the
Virgins of the Lord.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless: On a night in September the hurricane
raged over Manila, lashing the buildings with its gigantic wings. The
thunder crashed continuously. Lightning flashes momentarily revealed
the havoc wrought by the blast and threw the inhabitants into wild
terror. The rain fell in torrents. Each flash of the forked lightning
showed a piece of roofing or a window-blind flying through the air to
fall with a horrible crash. Not a person or a carriage moved through
the streets. When the hoarse reverberations of the thunder, a hundred
times re-echoed, lost themselves in the distance, there was heard the
soughing of the wind as it drove the raindrops with a continuous
tick-tack against the concha-panes of the closed windows.</p>
<p class="par">Two patrolmen sheltered themselves under the eaves of a
building near the nunnery, one a private and the other a
<i>distinguido</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of our staying here?&rdquo;
said the private.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11444" href=
"#xd24e11444" name="xd24e11444">496</a>]</span>&ldquo;No one is moving
about the streets. We ought to get into a house. My <i>querida</i>
lives in Calle Arzobispo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From here over there is quite a distance and
we&rsquo;ll get wet,&rdquo; answered the <i>distinguido</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What does that matter just so the lightning
doesn&rsquo;t strike us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah, don&rsquo;t worry! The nuns surely have a
lightningrod to protect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; observed the private, &ldquo;but of
what use is it when the night is so dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As he said this he looked upward to stare into the
darkness. At that moment a prolonged streak of lightning flashed,
followed by a terrific roar.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="tl">Nak&uacute;! Susmariosep!</i>&rdquo;
exclaimed the private, crossing himself and catching hold of his
companion. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, come away from here,&rdquo; he repeated
with his teeth rattling from fear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A specter!&rdquo; he murmured, trembling with
fright.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A specter?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On the roof there. It must be the nun who
practises magic during the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The <i>distinguido</i> thrust his head out to look, just
as a flash of lightning furrowed the heavens with a vein of fire and
sent a horrible crash earthwards. &ldquo;<i>Jes&uacute;s!</i>&rdquo; he
exclaimed, also crossing himself.</p>
<p class="par">In the brilliant glare of the celestial light he had
seen a white figure standing almost on the ridge of the roof with arms
and face raised toward the sky as if praying to it. The heavens
responded with lightning and thunderbolts!</p>
<p class="par">As the sound of the thunder rolled away a sad plaint was
heard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the wind, it&rsquo;s the
specter,&rdquo; murmured the private, as if in response to the pressure
of his companion&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11495" href=
"#xd24e11495" name="xd24e11495">497</a>]</span>&ldquo;Ay! Ay!&rdquo;
came through the air, rising above the noise of the rain, nor could the
whistling wind drown that sweet and mournful voice charged with
affliction.</p>
<p class="par">Again the lightning flashed with dazzling intensity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a specter!&rdquo; exclaimed
the <i>distinguido</i>.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her before. She&rsquo;s
beautiful, like the Virgin! Let&rsquo;s get away from here and report
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The private did not wait for him to repeat the
invitation, and both disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">Who was moaning in the middle of the night in spite of
the wind and rain and storm? Who was the timid maiden, the bride of
Christ, who defied the unchained elements and chose such a fearful
night under the open sky to breathe forth from so perilous a height her
complaints to God? Had the Lord abandoned his altar in the nunnery so
that He no longer heard her supplications? Did its arches perhaps
prevent the longings of the soul from rising up to the throne of the
Most Merciful?</p>
<p class="par">The tempest raged furiously nearly the whole night, nor
did a single star shine through the darkness. The despairing plaints
continued to mingle with the soughing of the wind, but they found
Nature and man alike deaf; God had hidden himself and heard not.</p>
<p class="par">On the following day, after the dark clouds had cleared
away and the sun shone again brightly in the limpid sky, there stopped
at the door of the nunnery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>&nbsp;Clara
a carriage, from which alighted a man who made himself known as a
representative of the authorities. He asked to be allowed to speak
immediately with the abbess and to see all the nuns.</p>
<p class="par">It is said that one of these, who appeared in a gown all
wet and torn, with tears and tales of horror begged the man&rsquo;s
protection against the outrages of hypocrisy. It is also said that she
was very beautiful and had the most lovely and expressive eyes that
were ever seen.</p>
<p class="par">The representative of the authorities did not accede to
her request, but, after talking with the abbess, left her there in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e11522" href="#xd24e11522" name=
"xd24e11522">498</a>]</span>spite of her tears and pleadings. The
youthful nun saw the door close behind him as a condemned person might
look upon the portals of Heaven closing against him, if ever Heaven
should come to be as cruel and unfeeling as men are. The abbess said
that she was a madwoman. The man may not have known that there is in
Manila a home for the demented; or perhaps he looked upon the nunnery
itself as an insane asylum, although it is claimed that he was quite
ignorant, especially in a matter of deciding whether a person is of
sound mind.</p>
<p class="par">It is also reported that General J&mdash;&mdash; thought
otherwise, when the matter reached his ears. He wished to protect the
madwoman and asked for her. But this time no beautiful and unprotected
maiden appeared, nor would the abbess permit a visit to the cloister,
forbidding it in the name of Religion and the Holy Statutes. Nothing
more was said of the affair, nor of the ill-starred Maria Clara.
